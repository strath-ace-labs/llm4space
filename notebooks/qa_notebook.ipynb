The ¼-wave junction design would be based on using molybdenum-copper inserts onto which the ferrite resonators are soldered for best heat conduction. The inserts would then be either soldered or adhered with a high electrical and thermal conductivity adhesive into a silver-plated aluminium alloy housing. The first of the ½-wave junction design possibilities with the dielectric / ferrite / dielectric structure would follow a similar flow to that of the ¼-wave junction. The second ½-wave junction design with the ferrite cylinder within a dielectric ring could have been simply adhered into the silver-plated aluminium waveguide housing since the thermal dissipation within this structure is spread out over a far larger area making the mounting seam far less critical. A separate matched termination would be designed, based on using Resin Systems RS-4200CHP silicon carbide composite material mounted in an aluminium alloy housing. The goal of the design would be to dissipate the power over as large an area as possible within the assembly to minimise the temperature rises and stresses on the materials. 6. TASK 103 INTRODUCTION This section of the report presents the detailed design of the Q-band isolator which is split into a number of steps described as follows: \\uf0b7 3-port junction circulator design – where the basic ferrite junction is designed to provide optimal transmission and reflection properties for the microwave signal \\uf0b7 Load design – where a ceramic load is designed to dissipate power reflected back into the isolator (up to 100% of the transmitted power) and maintain a good match to the RF over the frequency band and operating temperature range. \\uf0b7 Isolator design, where the two previous steps are combined to provide the isolator function. 6.1 3-Port Circulator Junction Design 6.1.1 Introduction The circulator design follows the work flow chart shown in Figure 27. A ferrite material with a saturation magnetisation of 5000 Gauss was selected for the design, as this gives a normalised magnetisation of 0.33, which is slightly outside the normal 0.4 to 0.8 operating range usually chosen for a ferrite material, but is the maximum value available due to the upper limit on the magnetisation moment of microwave ferrite materials. Initial geometries for the junction were roughly derived by review of possible junction topologies and then frequency / waveguide scaling of existing circulator designs.ESA Contract No: 4000108021 SUBJECT: High Power Q-Band Isolator - Final Report CONTRACTOR: COM DEV Europe Limited (t/a Honeywell) ESA CR( )No: 4000108021/2013/NL/WE No. of Volumes:….1 This is Volume No:…1 CONTRATOR’s REFERENCE: 11036-000-REP-FR Issue B Page 36 Figure 27 – Design Workflow The circulator RF design optimisation was carried out using the CST Microwave Studio finite element analysis software, allowing different geometries to be trialled and modified relatively quickly. Design parameters included: \\uf0b7 Ferrite shape - typically triangular prism or cylinder, but, in principle, any shape with the required 120° rotational symmetry \\uf0b7 Transformer shape (typically triangular, circular or rectangular) \\uf0b7 Ferrite size (diameter, thickness) \\uf0b7 Pedestal height (if any) �\\n___________________\\n As an optical source a Syntune laser was used with a wavelength of 1550 nm and an optical output power of 13 dBm. However, since there is no optical amplification after the MZM and the optical power at the photodetector is paramount to a good conversion gain, it was decided to maximize the optical power injection into the PIC. Therefor an EDFA was used to boost the optical power to 20 dBm. The coupling loss is estimated to be 3-5 dB from the imec PDK. We also maximized the driving power of the LO phase shifter, as this should improve the mixing efficiency. This was done by using a SHF 50 GHz amplifier with 24 dB of small-signal gain. However the amplifier saturates at an output power of 18 dBm (5 V pp ), limiting the maximum LO driving power. Figure 5-28: Overview of silicon push-pull mixer assembly 1 with CW light input. Optical carrier suppression is needed to achieve optimal down conversion. To achieve this the DPMZM contains three thermo-optic phase shifters which can be used to bias the MZM structure at minimum transmission. The minimum transmission point can be found by adjusting the thermo-optic phase shifters until a minimum amount of photocurrent is achieved. During this procedure it was found that the thermo-optic phase shifter of the LO MZM was not functional. However using the RF and main MZM thermo-optic phase shifter carrier suppression was achieved. We then down mixed an RF input of 26 GHz to 20 GHz using a LO signal of 6 GHz. For a bias voltage of -2 V at the APD an IF signal with a power of -56 dBm was found (frequency = 20 GHz). Again this low output power is mainly due to the fact that no optical amplification is integrated on the PIC after the MZM. We then proceeded to a measurement with pulsed light. We replaced the CW laser with the commercial MLL that was previously used (Calmar PSL-10-TT). In contrast to the measurement with the standard imec modulator an EDFA was used to boost the optical power to 20 dBm before sending the pulses to the PIC. Although the average power coupled to the PIC is identical to the CW laser measurement, the photocurrent at the photodiode was found to be lower. In the pulsed case, using carrier suppression, 8 uA was measured compared to 30 uA for the CW laser. Since the photocurrent is very small, this cannot be explained by PD saturation. This implies that there is a higher passive loss in the optical waveguides. The pulsed laser has a 10 GHz repetition rate and a pulse width of 3 ps, this implies that the peak power is approximately 30 times higher than the average power.

Page 70 of 85 non-linear losses above 50 mW, it is therefore safe to assume that a large portion of the optical power is absorbed in the first part of the silicon waveguide. We then proceeded to increase the reverse bias on the APD to increase the IF signal strength. However, when increasing the reverse bias it was found that the APD stopped functioning. We assume that we biased the APD to close to breakdown voltage while illuminating it with too high power pulses, causing irreversible damage to the APD. This was unexpected as we have measured the APD mechanism under higher pulsed power and did not find any breakdown. However, we continued our measurements with a second PCB with a DPMZM silicon mixer from the same die. 5.2.2.2 Assembly 2 For the second assembly we followed the same measurement routine described in the previous section. The PCB is identical in design to the previous assembly, the PIC is also almost identical except for a slight modification to the doping which shows very little influence as can be seen from the measurement of the individual devices prevented in a previous section in this document. One added benefit of this device was that all heater based phase shifters were working, therefore both the child MZMs could be biased at minimum. Combined with the biasing of the mother MZM optimal carrier suppression was achieved. We then performed first the CW mixing experiment again as is described in the previous section. 5.2.2.2.1 CW experiment The same IF signal strength was obtained, however with a lower average photoc\\n___________________\\n, G.

We then down mixed an RF input of 26 GHz to 20 GHz using a LO signal of 6 GHz. For a bias voltage of -2 V at the APD an IF signal with a power of -56 dBm was found (frequency = 20 GHz). Again this low output power is mainly due to the fact that no optical amplification is integrated on the PIC after the MZM. We then proceeded to a measurement with pulsed light. We replaced the CW laser with the commercial MLL that was previously used (Calmar PSL-10-TT). In contrast to the measurement with the standard imec modulator an EDFA was used to boost the optical power to 20 dBm before sending the pulses to the PIC. Although the average power coupled to the PIC is identical to the CW laser measurement, the photocurrent at the photodiode was found to be lower. In the pulsed case, using carrier suppression, 8 uA was measured compared to 30 uA for the CW laser. Since the photocurrent is very small, this cannot be explained by PD saturation. This implies that there is a higher passive loss in the optical waveguides. The pulsed laser has a 10 GHz repetition rate and a pulse width of 3 ps, this implies that the peak power is approximately 30 times higher than the average power.

Page 70 of 85 non-linear losses above 50 mW, it is therefore safe to assume that a large portion of the optical power is absorbed in the first part of the silicon waveguide. We then proceeded to increase the reverse bias on the APD to increase the IF signal strength. However, when increasing the reverse bias it was found that the APD stopped functioning. We assume that we biased the APD to close to breakdown voltage while illuminating it with too high power pulses, causing irreversible damage to the APD. This was unexpected as we have measured the APD mechanism under higher pulsed power and did not find any breakdown. However, we continued our measurements with a second PCB with a DPMZM silicon mixer from the same die. 5.2.2.2 Assembly 2 For the second assembly we followed the same measurement routine described in the previous section. The PCB is identical in design to the previous assembly, the PIC is also almost identical except for a slight modification to the doping which shows very little influence as can be seen from the measurement of the individual devices prevented in a previous section in this document. One added benefit of this device was that all heater based phase shifters were working, therefore both the child MZMs could be biased at minimum. Combined with the biasing of the mother MZM optimal carrier suppression was achieved. We then performed first the CW mixing experiment again as is described in the previous section. 5.2.2.2.1 CW experiment The same IF signal strength was obtained, however with a lower average photoc', ', G.
