And I am delighted to bring to you our 70 plus session for Knowledge Capture. We've been doing it for over eight years now and it just still is just a pleasure to do that and to have Jim McBaron with us today. What I'd like to do is just tell you a little bit about Jim. I could go on all day. His expertise with spacesuits is phenomenal. We're very fortunate to have Jim here and he's committed to us through a contract with the JSC Knowledge Office here at JSC as well. So we thank them for contributing to his session today. But Jim comes a long way. He started back at the University of Dayton in Ohio with a bachelor's degree in geology and went on to get a master's in business administration later at University of Houston Clear Lake. But while he was at University of Dayton, he got involved with the test program at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and he became a test subject for suits, high-altitude suits, and looking at pressurization in those suits. And so that experience ultimately led to him being hired by NASA and he continued on to have a 40-year plus career in NASA and became the branch chief and chief engineer for all the work associated with spacesuits. And so he's now retired from NASA and he went on to work as a consultant and he's still working as a consultant and actually we're in the process of hiring him as a consultant as well as doing the knowledge capture events. So without further ado please give a hand to Jim McBaron. Thank you, Cinda, for the nice introduction again. Let's go on to the second chart. What I'm going to talk about today is a little bit of background on the ASTP project itself in case you're not familiar with it. Then I'm going to go through the requirements which are to me very important at the front end of any program even when it's reuse of a suit for a different purpose like the ASTP project required. Then I'm going to go through some lessons learned and then for the first time I'm going to go a little bit in cost and labor data that I have not presented previously. I've had a lot of questions from people about, you know, how many people do you have working on the program? How much did it cost? How much did a suit cost? And there were never any good answers, but I've got some charts from a study that was done at the end of the contract that the suits were developed under that I thought I'd present to you to give it a little insight into what it took to do what we did for all the Apollo Skylab and ASDP project flight. Background on the project itself, back in 72 there was a joint agreement signed between the United States and the Soviet Union, not Russia, to establish a common universal docking system for future spacecraft missions. It It took until July of 1975 for two manned spacecraft, one Soviet and one American, to launch into Earth orbit. The American was the Apollo Command and Service Module with a special docking module that was developed in the United States and a Soyuz from the Soyuz Cosmodrome. The two spacecraft rendezvoused, docked and conducted two days of docked operations successfully in orbit. The crews transferred between the spacecraft through the docking module four times and they did numerous scientific evaluations and investigations. In 75 of July 19th, that's an interesting date, the Xolias crew returned safely back to Earth. The U.S. crew stayed on orbit for another almost a week to do additional research and scientific evaluations landing on July 24th. This gives you sort of an illustration, of course I can't point out too well, but on the left is the Apollo Command and Service Module and attached to it is the US provided docking module. And then on the right is the Soyuz Launch Service Module and in the center there is Soyuz Docking Module. In between the two is the common docking adapter that was used to evaluate the docking protocol for the two countries. Now I'm going to get into the mission requirements. First thing of any suit development project or any use is to make sure that you have the correct mission requirements. You can go way out in the left field developing advanced suit stuff and find out that when you're ready to do the real project you didn't do the right thing. It can cost a lot of money and a lot of manpower. So I just wanted to go through what the mission requirements were for the ASTP. It was to conduct suited oxygen pre-breathe before launch from the suit room through the transfer van up the gantry to the command module. That's how pre-breathe was accomplished back in those days. Crew wore the spacesuits attached to the command module environmental control system at normal ventilation pressure of 0.2 psi, that was called vent pressure, During critical mission phases, that was a requirement to wear the suits during those times. And that was at launch, of course, during Soyuz docking and during common module undocking when we undocked from the Soyuz spacecraft. Also to provide short-term emergency pressurization in the event of a decompression of the command module itself, in which time the crewman was expected to operate the required controls and have access visibility wise for vision to do that in event of the cabin pressure loss. No EVA was required with this suit. So you'll see that when we get into the design. Interface requirements of course 100% oxygen atmosphere inside the command module to be compatible at 5 psi pressure which was a normal spacecraft operating pressure including in the docking module and we were attached to the CILIAs. Be compatible with the couch launch and landing restraint system, all navigation and control optical systems and controls visibility and operation. That was sort of the command module requirements. In addition the PGA itself, pressure garment assembly, required to have self connect and disconnect capability for all command module connections which in this case only was the command module ECS inlet and outlet connector. The medical people still required like on previous missions that we have a medical self-injector patch on the leg so that crewman could inject himself with a special drug in event he had a medical emergency and it could go through the suit wall without affecting the suit pressure and there was a special self adhesive patch that would close in event of a puncture from the needle and withdrawal. Post landing water survival life rest of course an event that the crewman needed to evacuate the command module upon landing in the ocean because it was a water entry and entry into a life raft from which was part of survival equipment. Of course environmental requirements we still had a requirement for oxygen compatibility and odor and toxicity in the command module and humidity. These sort of were sort of assert requirements for environmental compatibility. During pre-launch conditions, of course, salt fog and sand and dust, which was the environment at Cape Kennedy in the event the crewman comes out of the suit donning room and enters the van, transfers to the pad and up the gantry. So there was exposure to salt fog and salt dust that we had to certify the suit for. Of course there was launch vibration, acceleration, and acoustic noise so that Kuhlman could hear with the control center"

So there was exposure to salt fog and salt dust that we had to certify the suit for. Of course there was launch vibration, acceleration, and acoustic noise so that Kuhlman could hear with the control center back in the Cape as well as in Houston, and to be compatible with water landing impact with the couch restraint system. The contract itself, the ILC contract, NES 960-100, provided custom sized suits for each mission assigned crew member. That included training suits, flight suits, and flight backup suits for each prime flight crew member, all men, and provided only training and flight spacesuits for the backup crew. What this meant was we had to build and provide 15 suits per flight to support flights on a two-month launch center. I'll give you an idea when we get talking about labor later and cost of what it took to do that. It was required to deliver training suits 12 months before flight of course so that the crew member could have the suits available to support training in a vehicle and in the trainers. This was a unique requirement upon us was because we had to start building the suits suits before the 12 months. And of course in several cases the crew weren't identified yet. And through several conversations with the head of the astronaut office we worked out a special code that we built the suits to before the crew were announced to the public, even approved by NASA headquarters in some cases, on a gamble that they would be the correct ones. And it always worked out, you know. So the astronaut office always knew first who was going to fly. I don't know the protocol and all that, but we built the suits to this code, and it was a star code. And each crew member was given a star name. And when we transferred the name between my boss and myself, the only NASA people that had access to the code, to the program manager and the chief pattern maker at ILC, the only four people that knew the code and who the crew were, the ILC was able to manufacture the codes. And in fact some of the suits, if you ever see them, you'll see a label in there with a star name. And that's because they were built past the point of putting in a label and we told them to put in a star name. So you mean like Antares or Sirius? Like Castor on Gemini. In addition, flight suits were delivered six months before flight so that there would be time to do chamber testing, to train the crew in the use of the suit in altitude chambers both at JSC, Manned Space Flight Center then, and at the CAPE in a command module altitude chamber verification in order to be tested in the command module at altitude. And of course the backup flight suits delivered three months before flight so that the crew would have them available at the time of launch in event they were needed and some problem developed with the flight suit that they had to go to the backup, which happened on a couple of occasions. Primarily due to the crew member preference in terms of size, not because of a suit problem. The contractor support requirements that we leveled on the contractor that each suit had to have a minimum of four year age life from completion of pre-delivery acceptance tests, which were conducted before each suit was delivered to NASA and approved for acceptance. Provide suit maintenance and check out support support for interface test and crew training at Johnson, provide pre-flight suit maintenance and pre-installation checkout support for command module altitude test, interface test, for the countdown demonstration verification before launch and at launch at NASA KSC. In addition they provided engineering support for testing and in-flight mission analysis both at the contractors plant and here at JSC and I think Moroni you remember doing that you were part of that. In terms of the design requirements for the suit for the ASTP flight of course we had operated both vent command module vent normal pressure 0.2 psi and at 3.75 psi operating pressure in the event of a decompression within the spacecraft. To prove the viability of the suit we subjected each suit to a a six PSI proof pressure test at the manufacturer's plant before acceptance. During certification we did eight PSI structural on a cert suit after completion of all the cert tests and there was a one-time test on a suit just to see how much pressure it would stand before it burst and it was 10 PSI. In terms of compatibility with environmental control system we had to minimize the pressure drop from the inlet to suit outlet which was 4.7 inches of water at the maximum inlet flow to the suit from the command module ECS system having a flow rate of 12 cubic feet per minute with the diverter valve on a suit gas connector in the open position which was the only position that was required for this mission since we didn't have an EVA requirement if you switched from the verter valve to a to the opposite position it rooted only half of the flow to the helmet and then half of the flow to us to the suit for for cooling when you had a liquid cooling garment available to you for liquid cooling when you were connected to the plis on the Apollo or the Elsa on a Skylab missions leakage less 180 cc's per minute at both vent pressure the normal operating pressure and at the suit pressure at 3.7 The helmet CO2 had to be maintained at less than 16 millimeters of mercury at the maximum peak workload of 1600 BTUs per hour that was levied by the medical people and proven by many tests. We provided a helmet mounted feed port like we did on the previous missions for suit nourishment primarily drinking water and food tubes if they wanted such. Provided adequate gloves with dexterity and fingers tactility to operate all command module controls and vision in the helmet for actually seeing the displays and all the mentioned interfaces that the crewman was required to interface with. And finally provide water landing ocean water immersion capability which means that once you jumped in the water the suit didn't fill with water so we had a neck dam you provided to when a crew member took the helmet off there was a neck dam to provide water from entering into the suit from the neck as well as the gas connectors had poppets which would close when you remove the nozzle so that the suit would not fill with water through the gas connector like which occurred on Gas Charisms mission back in Mercury. This is a basic configuration of the ASTP suit. The baseline design that was picked at the time was based on what was in the most convenient to manufacture for ILC at the most reasonable cost for us that we didn't want an expensive suit and that was the Apollo 17 command module pilot configuration EVA suit with modifications required to be compatible with the ASTP. These included deleting one set of the ECS gas connectors since it was not required for EVA in connection with the"

These included deleting one set of the ECS gas connectors since it was not required for EVA in connection with the other life support system. Deleted the liquid cooling garment connector. Deleted the life support system attachment brackets and pressure relief valve to be compatible with the PLSS system. Deleted the lunar module tether brackets since we weren't going to interface with the LEM. And for convenience we incorporated Skylab A7LB EVA PGA boost because those are the ones that were in manufacture at the time and they provided adequate interface for the the interfaces on the ASDP. You can see the gray shoulder straps on right and left. What those are are straps to connect the underarms life vest assembly. We replaced the EVA multi-layer insulation garment, the TMG, with an IBCL, an infra-hicular cover layer, a two layer garment consisting of Teflon beta cloth and PBI fabric. This provided adequate flammability protection to the suit in the event of an incident inside the command module or the docking module. No provided LCG gloves or visor assembly, so strictly an IV suit. and you can see I can't point them out to you see the one set of gas connectors on the left side under the hose connected to the electrical umbilical which was that line running down IV gloves and pressure gauge on a left arm the urine transfer fitting on the upper left right leg for transferring urine from inside the UCD to the vehicle system. And, of course, the bubble helmet, like we used in our prior Apollo missions. Snoopy cap or comm carrier with redundant wired microphones and earphones. This is a schematic for the ventilation system that was used for the command module ECS. It's one set of inlet and outlet connectors with ventilation all to the helmet and then out from the arms and legs to the environmental control system inlet to the ECS. Pretty much the same system as we used in our prior missions except it was modified for one set of gas connectors. This is an overall view of the suit the way it looked Starting with coming down this side, the pressure helmet, the helmet disconnect, standard helmet disconnect we used prior missions, electrical connector on the chest, a pen-like pocket on the arm, upper arm, of course the IV glove, a utility pocket, the data list pocket, the IVCL boot, checklist pocket on the lower leg, opposite side, a scissors pocket, the urine transfer connector, the medical injection flap that you open up to put the injection into the suit, an active dosimeter pocket for radiation monitoring, the interest flap over the pressure sealing slide flask with two snaps to hold it in place, pressure gauge on the arm, the IVCL, the cover layer itself, a sunglass pocket on the upper arm, a flange and mounting for the electrical connector, and of course the communication carrier. That's sort of the what were the all the components of the suit and of course the Skylab boots and included the Skylab boot heel restraint although it wasn't needed for the mission. The urine collection device was a standard device they used on prior flights. They accommodated crewman, crew man because we didn't have females at the time. In-suit storage of urine of 950 CC's capability to transfer fluid from inside the soup to a command module storage container either in event mode or the pressure mode pressurized mode one standard size of foreign roll on cusps which attached the UCD to the man a minimum I mean maximum air pressure decay for leakage after five minutes as shown a proof pressure of 2 psi and it was disposable for one mission use only which was the ASTP mission. You can see the material is made out of urethane coated nylon. The black things are Velcro for attaching it on the back side of the restraint. The rolling cuff attached at that metal device on the center lower. And on the right is the pocket for the UC. There's a hose for the UCTA with a connector that connected to that pocket, which was actually an ancillary pocket that was mounted a tube was mounted on the inside of the suit that that hose connected to the ucpa connected to so that you get transfer out through the ucpa connector to the storage facility in a command module yes one mission use only each man had only one for the mission and he put it on three times yes during the mission right yeah he carried spares however if they wanted but that was the requirement one mission use. What the one mission use meant that had the capability of being used how many times it was required on the mission and I think it was three times was a certain requirement okay. Now they may have switched them out I don't know I mean that was their personal preference. They carried three total per crew member I believe. This is a constant wear garment that was worn as the inside garment before you donned the suit. It was made out of cotton. It provided comfort for launch and suited mission phases. It covered the arms, upper arms, torso and legs. We had separate donned and doffed cotton socks and attachment provision with snaps for the biomedical instrumentation which is located in the center there and there was a little pocket up there in the chest area which was a passive dosimeter that was stowed on a suit to measure radioactivity radiation in a passive mode. The comm carrier, a Snoopy hat, worn through all the Apollo missions was government furnished equipment provided to us from the David Clark Company. We'd The reason we did that is ILC was never successful in developing a comfortable, compatible Snoopy cap and ILC did so we made it GFE and provided it to ILC and it worked fine. It was self-donning and doffing with attachment to the PGA electrical harness which you see coming down to a connector here on the bottom. It had redundant microphones and earphones. It had six standard sizes. We had optional used chin and neck strap for the crew member to attach it to his head and a connector on it down at the bottom there for EEH attachment. The brown looking material is woven Teflon material and the inside of the ear cups are a cotton material for comfort. The microphones were provided by Plantronics. noise-canceling microphones? Yes and then in the center you can't see it here because it's covered up is a white stretchy nylon material. Just a lot of pictures it looks black. Yeah it's a brownish looking material the standard color of that material itself that was woven. Jim, does David Clark still make them for the shuttle EMU or does ILC make those? ILC makes them now.

This is the electrical harness. We have 61 pin connector located in the center for connecting all the biomedical leads and the communications leads. And that electrical harness connected to the comm carrier and then connected to bio instrumentation belt that was provided by the medical people and it provided all the adequate compatible connectors which were all made by airlock the suit manufacturer for almost all the hardware on the suit certification the suit mostly was done by similarity analysis was done to show that the life Life requirements in terms of the number of cycles of the joints and all the hardware features on the suit were met by the Apollo 15 to 17 CMP missions use. Environments were similar to all those that were used previously in Apollo, Apollo 7 through 17. And interfaces were successfully demonstrated during crew training, both at JSC and KSC, during the CMP spacesuit certification test in flight. So no additional testing was required, but there was a report required that provided this data that showed that we were certified with all the details to get the system to accept it. So there was a document for certification rather than a test. The AST mission itself in July 1975 to demonstrate compatible U.S. and Soviet docking standard for international flights, crew transfer between vehicles, and of course the interact, which was important, was the interaction between the control centers located in the Soviet Union and here at Johnson and KSC and their launch site. So there was quite a bit of work going on just to provide the communication capability with the four possible interfacing centers to do the communications. The other objective was to conduct engineering and scientific evaluations. There's an excellent project summary document that NASA put out that contains a listing of all the experiments and investigations that were done and the results if you're ever interested. The Apollo crew of course was Tom Stafford who was the commander, Vance Brand the pilot for the command module and the docking module pilot was Deke Slaton. The Soviet crew of course was Alexei Leonov, I don't know if you're familiar with Mr. Leonov, first man that went to EVA. And the flight engineer Valery Kubasov, I hope I pronounced his name right. And those are their pictures shown there in their suits ready for flight or in a training facility. During the countdown demonstration test at the Cape, excessive ECS leakage was observed in the command module system in the low pressure vent mode, not when the suit was pressurized, but in the normal operating mode. And no leakage occurred in the high pressure contingency mode of 3.5 psi. That leakage was traced to Vance Brand's suit, specifically to his, during failure analysis at JSC to his pressure ceiling slide fastener, which was used for entry and donning, you know, the closure that ran from the upper crotch around the back. And it was induced when a crew member was strapped in the couch, which turned out was causing the pressure ceiling lips to separate and allowed leakage to occur. This was the first time we've ever seen this problem and all the uses of that suit configuration in Gemini and the early Apollo A7L suit uses and a CMP suit. This was the first time we've ever seen a significant low-pressure leak in that closure. Now, we did have that problem during Mercury, just prior to John Glenn's flight during a countdown demonstration test, and we had to send the suit back to BF Goodrich in Akron to have the closure replaced due to low pressure leakage, excessive low pressure leakage. So was that a divide or was that a quality issue? It was a position sensitive issue as well as a size issue where the size of the suit curve curve in the crotch area can combine with the pressure from laying in the couch the command module couch cause those lifts to separate now there was only a low pressure leak problem of course that was the normal mode of operation is low pressure and I'll get into that later in lessons learned about closures about that specific closure design but the way they fixed the problem for this sort of a Rube Goldberg fix for this mission they put a inserted a piece of two tie-gown tubing around the radius of that curvature between the ceiling lips and the exterior restraint zipper structure zipper which stopped the leakage they did some cert tests of that to flex this the suit cycle the suit under pressure as well as have the crewman evaluated and they found no problems and that's what they flew so it's like a unit fix one time only mission one crew member fix that solved the problem it was a big deal back then the zipper the BF Goodrich I called pressure-saving slide faster that was the official their term it says it contained a towel on zipper where with interlocking teeth and they had molded rubber neoprene lips that would be forced together when you close the zipper towel on zipper locks best way to describe it I think and it was used in the ace this use in the aces suit a lot of David Clark flying suits and it's not a problem and the reason as they don't don't have a low pressure leakage requirement. Once you get in an environmental control system where leakage is important to the system operation, at that leakage rate that we have a requirement 180 CC's, it became a problem. And during ground use of this closure in Apollo missions and Gemini missions and even in Mercury, we had problems with those slips leaking that required replacement of the closure before flight. But never did we get to the CDDT except in this mission on Apollo and on Mercury where we actually had to change the zipper out. Got me in a bunch of trouble with Kenny Kleinknecht at that time. Anyway it worked out okay. Now I'm going to get in some lessons learned. I talked a little bit about the closure but first I'm going to talk about the problems we had with the mobility joints which required restraint cables to be embedded inside the convolute and attached to the patches on a PGA restraint the fabric restraint through the use of swedges the cables are attached to swedges and a cable swedge design resulted in numerous cable breaks during cycle life testing and redesigns we had special quality control requirements of course the swedge is put on with a special swedge tool over a round piece of metal and they cramp it and there's no way to verify how good the swedge was after you you switch it so we test five wedges before and five switches after and pull them in a stress test on an instron to verify that yep the switch should work and Ronnie's familiar with those problems we had right and so the recommendation that we came up with for future programs is we should not use restraint cables like we had an Apollo with swedge termination fittings for any mobility joints and future spacesuits design we implemented that requirement and shuttle EM"

So that's when we switched to all fabric webbing design in lieu of cables. So that's been implemented for shuttle but it still stands for all future advanced spacesuits. Be careful of swedges and cables. The Apollo ASTP suit, Skylab suit, all those suits used a molded and dipped rubber compound that was a proprietary compound of IOC. It came from Platex originally, which was a girdle manufacturer and it actually was a compound they developed for using girdles way back in the 50s. And it limited the spacecraft's reuse to four years, which meant that it was hard to fly suit, bring it back to ground and refly it again with all the lead times that were required. In addition, that found that preparatory compound had a defect in it with a copper contaminant in it and the dipping compound resulted in the Apollo 14 problem I described to you earlier where we had to change out the boot bladders where the natural rubber part of the neoprene natural rubber compound was affected by the copper contaminant that resulted in premature aging and failure of the bladder itself. So a recommendation for future programmers to specify a longer age-life requirement, which we did, which required six years on a shuttle EMU suit back then, and to preclude use of any proprietary materials in future suits. If you don't know what's in it, you shouldn't use it. And that was a lesson that was very expensive for us to learn. Significance of crewman induced loads. You know we have plug loads or the pressure loads in the suit and it turns out we found out way back in early Apollo, A6L version, that the man induced loads was greater than the plug or pressure load. and sometimes very significantly in the waist and upper thigh of the suit. And we found those loads by instrumenting a suit with load cells, actually going through during different motions in the suit, measuring the loads, and then we took those loads and we reposed those on the contractor so that he was required to test every component during manufacture before the suit was installed in the suit to verify the loads were adequate for the design. And we recommend that the first unit of every suit, new suit program, you ought to take a suit and instrument it because the man loads are independent, or dependent upon, not independent, dependent upon the configuration of the suit and how the loads are distributed by the different joints and connections like waist rings or thigh bearings or whatever connectors you might have. The man loads can vary, so I would recommend that for all future suits, you instrument a suit and define what the loads are and make sure that's how you certify the suit to. Here we talk about the BF Goodrich type zipper I mentioned a little earlier, where we had frequent factory replacements necessary going all the way back to mercury. The one instance on ASTP I discussed, I specifically went up to BF Goodrich and Akron and was approved to observe their manufacturing, their proprietary manufacturing process of how they manufacture these closures. I was shocked to see the condition of the facility, how crude the controls were. I mean it was just people building things to memory and they had a root sheet, you know, to build this one, this length, very imprecise. And they would not change that for us because it was a vendor product that they sold a lot of to industry for other uses and they didn't want to increase the price of the closure. So we got them to, on NASA purchase orders, to do a final in-process selection inspection of the closures that they delivered to us. And that's what we used during Mercury and subsequent missions Gemini and Apollo. And I think David Clark also instituted that system when they procured suits for the Air Force use. It's interesting, interesting data point is I was told by BF Goodrich that the Soviet Union suit people bought 50 closures per test and they sent them back and said we don't want to use these anymore. Well, they weren't to the NASA standard. That was delivered to them. That was sort of interesting. So they never used a pressure sealing closure in their suit. use a roll up bladder in the waste area. So the recommendation that we found from this, always to make sure if you're using that kind of closure, to make sure you put a test in place to test low pressure leakage. And ideally to design and develop a new type of closure in lieu of a pressure sealing slide fastener which we did for shuttle using the waste ring which was optimized for EVA only but the ACES suit and other suits that are worn during a launch can't have this problem especially if they're connected to the environmental control system where they have a low pressure leakage requirement that did not exist for some of the ACES suits where they were ventilated with the fan separate from the environmental control system on shuttle. So that is a problem I'm concerned about for Orion because I understand they're going to be using this type of closure in the Orion suit. And I don't know if they have a low-pressure leakage requirement imposed on that, but they should. During life cycle testing we observed, and during crew training, we found high abrasion areas on the suit. suit, self-abrasion we call it because the suit when flexing the joints itself and flexing against cables would create wear points which eventually could revolt in a hole and leakage. And those orange colored patches you see on the torso and limb suit, those are patches were put on for abrasion resistance to fix leakage problems and for the A7LB EV suit we actually covered a complete suit with a restraint outer layer scuff protection layer as well as a trico on the inside of the whole suit of the convolute center restraint which was the big difference in life endurance capability between the a7l and a7lb EV suit was was the complete redesign of the convolutes and the bladder which we did recommendation verified design accuracy of pressure integrity by doing the lifecycle testing at the required suit pressure to identify any high areas for correction because when the suit flexes, the joints rub against each other wherever there's a possibility of rubbing and you can get a hole which would result eventually in leakage. And do this life cycle testing before you can submit the suit to any man hazardous use just to make sure you don't have a problem of the crew member in test.

The formula that we use for life cycle endurance testing which was two time was the total cycles required was two times the mission test cycles and contingency cycles we found very acceptable for use in all the all the missions it worked out very well this was different than a standard of four times that space hardware usually uses four times its usual life and we found that that four times sometimes resulted in more cycles and was required which would require redesign of the suit you didn't want or was not adequate in terms of total cycles for the cycles you saw the suit being exposed to. Lockpots on all pressure integrity connections. We've had several incidences during Gemini and Apollo where during ground training the gas connectors were inadvertently, the gas connector or a wrist disconnect was inadvertently opened by a restraint belt, a tether or a couch restraint belt during testing and I personally experienced this second one I added this in here at Wright-Patt. I was in a low pressure vacuum chamber at equivalent of 100,000 feet in one of the Air Force suits and the visor failed and opened and I was subjected to vacuum for a period of 12 seconds. Of course I blacked out immediately and it was due to an inadequate design of the latch that connected that visor to the helmet. So I had a very personal experience that I used to remind myself during the design of all the Apollo, Gemini and Apollo to make sure we had adequate lock locks to prevent accidental disconnection because you could have loss of life in event that would happen. And you need to put those disconnect lock locks on all pressure integrity connections for all future both IV and EV suits. These are like helmet to neck ring and pressure visor to helmet, gloves to arms, gas connectors, LCG inner water connector like we had in Apollo where the LCG connected to the inside of the suit we didn't want that to open up you'd open up a hole to the outside and the pressure sealing closure we actually put a lock lock on a pressure sealing closure lock when you pull the closure up and attached it and it was fast as we had a lock at the end so it couldn't be accidentally open which would be a very bad day for a crew member. Lunar dust contamination we experienced in Apollo of course I mentioned this during your prior follow briefings we found a connects and disconnects were difficult to operate on a lunar module entry and preparation for the next EVA and a chest mounted remote control unit had a display on it got covered with dust so it's difficult for readout and the dust contamination mostly was on the lower legs and boots and created a possible contamination problem in the atmosphere of the lamb due to breathing concerns If we go to Mars, we could have this problem and future spacesuit designs need to take into consideration a requirement for dust protection, not only to make sure the connectors operate but also that you prevent reentry dust coming back into the habitable and breathing environment in a vehicle. During Skylab the crew reported that they observed body growth of between 1 to 1.5 inches during their total exposure to microgravity, which made suit downing more difficult. And design of future suits that's going to be in microgravity environment for a long period of time need to include this in their sizing system for self-sizing the suit. The Space Shuttle EMU did by adding a one-inch waist adjustment between normal ground training use and flight use in their flight suits. That's recommended. And the Skylab crew reported they didn't use the vehicle containment system that was provided in Apollo because they didn't think it was necessary for a six-hour period. It was primarily provided for 115-hour pressurized return in a suit from the lunar surface. So just for six hours you don't need it. I mean that's just pretty obvious now. And the design of future manned spacecraft should include a mandatory, robust and versatile EVA capability. This is sort of trying to make people aware that EVA is a vital part of any future spacecraft system. The Apollo Command Module stand-up capability was necessary to enable the crew to inspect photograph the station to make sure how do we fix it before we save the system and prevent the fixes to the launch damage. And the orbital workshop continues the EVA to deploy the damaged solar wing. So Skylab showed that we really need to have a viable EVA capability on every mission. Every spacecraft needs to have that capability, either to repair solar power wings, solar power stations, deploy things that would be required before you re-enter that might be located on the outside of the heat shield structure, and so on. So just a sell point that you need to consider that. A little change now. This is the total number of suits that was made under NS9-6100 and DD-250. The DD-250 was a document that transferred the ownership of the suit from the contractor that made it, ILC, to NASA. And if you went back through the DD-250 records by the fiscal years, you see that a total of 222 suits were made under that contract. Just remember that we required 15 suits per mission plus certification suits, plus suits we provided for LTA-8 LEM certification testing at Grumman. We provided suits at Rockwell for command module testing and 2TV-1 thermal back testing at JSC. We provided suits for numerous uses including suits that were used at Marshall in their water immersion facility in development of the Skylab system. That shows you the total number developed by type. And the 5L was under a separate contract which was a short term letter contract with ILC under NAS 95332 in which the 5L early program support suits were developed back in 1966. And of course nine suits in 1973 for the ASTP project. What if you needed 15 for ASTP? What happened to the other six? We reused the CMP suits for training. They were retrofitted and reduced for training. Oh. Try to save money. and this came out of the Apollo Skylab suit program management system study report that we had done at the end of the NS960-100 contract. So that gives you an idea of how many suits were made total and types and when delivered. Pretty interesting summary chart. This shows you the number of man months per month that were expended by ILC and ILC direct labor personnel that worked on the contract from the start in 1966 through the end of 1973. And it has a breakout of the plant people versus the field people. There's sort of an anomaly, you can't see it, in the first quarter 1970, or the second quarter, I think that's a problem of either a long month or a mistake in calculation that was done in"

There's sort of an anomaly, you can't see it, in the first quarter 1970, or the second quarter, I think that's a problem of either a long month or a mistake in calculation that was done in converting man hours to man months when the study was done. Across the top are the program milestones, or the missions. I apologize for the quality of the chart, but this is the best I could get out of that report. It starts with Apollo 7 through SL4 and then ASTP out here. The suit milestones were suit reviews like CDRs, FASIs. And you see this enormous buildup to provide the suits for the launch requirement of launches every two months from Apollo 7 through 14. They slacked off a bunch a little bit between 2015 and 2017 and Skylab. So that gives you an idea of how many people. If you can convert man months to people, a lot of people worked on the program. In terms of dollars, $62 million were spent on a contract from 66 to 77. There's the 75, 76, 77 where there's a small amount of field support that were provided to support advanced spacesuit work that were being done at JSC at the time. But you can see the production costs, the development costs, and the cost for mission support, field support, all broken down in terms of man hours. And this is dollars, I'm sorry, in this chart. is all dollars fiscal year then fiscal year dollars if you want to look at it man hours by program they also broke it down Apollo 7 to 14 Apollo 15 17 Skylab and ASDP for a total of percent of factory total total number of man hours worked on the program and a number of suits that were delivered for that amount of man hours. Very interesting. I hope that people that are putting together budgets for future programs can get an idea what it's going to take. Now this was for a unique suit configuration or it was custom made for each crew member and you can't afford that for future programs. I know we couldn't afford it for shuttle, we went to a standard size, but it does give you some idea. This is sort of a summary of the sessions that I've already provided to you that's available, going to be available from CINDA when the time is right when they're released and I have two yet to go on Shuttle First, Early Shuttle and Early Station. So that's sort of unless you have some questions I have in the back of this references for the ASDP and then the Apollo significant references that are our data that you might ever want to refer to yes during the dynamic mission phases launched docking and undocking is that undocking from Soyuz but undocking from the docking module they did not need to suit up they trusted that hat I couldn't find that in a data and I didn't remember that I don't think so but then docking they did right but remember docking was was had active pedals and apparently that wasn't required I mean that wasn't the suit people's input that came out of the operations and management anybody else yes do you have any information on the flotation device that you mentioned early in the presentation for crew survival? Yeah, the crew survival equipment was provided by NASA, developed by our soft goods lab at the time. And we had underarm life vests and a survival life raft that were made in crew systems. I do have some information on that, but I don't have that much. They were under the job was Jim Barnett, was a NASA manager at the time, and of course he's not with us anymore. But yeah, there's information on that. It should be available in the Crew Systems Library for sure, I would think. We develop life, all kind of. Matt Radnowski was the big materials expert at the time and was in charge of survival equipment, starting with the Gemini on and we provided through crew systems the life rafts life vests for survival water survival and we did a lot of the testing with the suits at the Ellington Air Force Base officers Club pool that was before we had a water immersion pool here and then later we did it in a pool that was in building 29 which is gone. So now you would go the NBL I assume but we did a lot of water compatibility and and we did some down at the Cape in a Holiday Inn pool that where we made a last last-minute modification on some flight hardware at the Cape and I actually served as the test subject to jump in the pool at the Holiday Inn to test it out back way back when. Boy it was a lot of people to watch. Yeah. You mentioned that the suits had a neck ring, neck dam, so I never really thought of it, but in the water landings if they fell out of the module somehow they'd float? With a neck dam on, yes. They sure would. They didn't have to worry about sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Correct. And it was a neoprene neck dam and it had a, it was designed in a conical shape. with ribs and each rib if you cut it just right you can get different neck sizes. And we did that, actually IOC made the neck dam and it attached into the locking ring of the helmet where the helmet normally would go on the torso side of the neck ring, would attach to it. In Gemini we had a roll up cuff over the neck ring where you could unroll it to get a neck seal get a neck seal because it was found to be necessary for Gemini for water landing as well. So you need a way, because once a crew member disconnects from the environmental control system, he needs a breathing source. And of course the atmosphere is the best one, but you've got to take the helmet off and get on a neck dam to provide that capability. You talked about the certification of the AST based on dust exposure. Yes. What limit do you use, what to certify to, in other words, you say that, you know, you The Apollo program had a standard environmental, the Apollo program had a standard environmental requirement specification for certification. And this specified dust size, velocity, grain size, velocity, magnitude, you know, the quantity grains that we had to meet which was based on the KSC exposure environment you know the same thing is for salt fog we have so we tested all the suits and salt fog we we tested in salt fog and suits that come out white practically all of them helmet in particular as it was coated with salt and then we had to demonstrate the connectors would operate successfully after that connectors and neck rings and wrist rings. Yes sir? In talking about new areas and stuff, what's your thought or, well, I guess what's your overall perspective"

Yes sir? In talking about new areas and stuff, what's your thought or, well, I guess what's your overall perspective on the suit ports? Have you seen the work that they're doing? I think it's a very unique concept. Mr. Cohen, I think, was the one that originally developed that out at the Ames. The suit port seems like a good solution if you have a vehicle that's on the surface say a moon or Mars, and you need an easy way to have access to the lunar surface. My concern is the inexperience between the suit people that I know exist, both NASA and the contractor, and the vehicle people to make the thing work. You know, that's a new interface that neither side has ever worked before. My experience with the vehicle people is they like to impose requirements that are unreal on the suit people. And the suit people try and impose requirements on a vehicle unsuccessfully. Because usually the suit comes on after the vehicle interfaces are done. And then you've got to make those work and change if possible. So that's been my experience. The suit always comes you need to start to suit early when the vehicles get in development so that you can work the interfaces in parallel Rather than have the suit come last which is has been the case practically every program I've worked on Yes, sir No, I have not Should be. That was the end of the program. I mean, yeah, that was the end of this contract. I was on this contract for ten years. I was the contract tech monitor. And although it showed we spent $62 million, at the end of the contract, we had a million two dollar under run that the contractor and us were able to work. Cost was a very big driver back then. Cost and weight. driven drove a lot of design issues especially when you consider when the limb was being designed they were Kim milling the hardware to keep the weight to reduce the weight so weight of a suit is is not only important how the suit operates but for the interfaces with the vehicle and yeah anything else yes ma'am How heavy is the suit? How heavy? Which one? Whatever you want. Okay. Suits are varied in mercury from in the 20 to 30 pound range for a suit to Gemini was probably 50 pounds, Apollo. And it depends on EV or IV. IV was mercury. Gemini had two types, IV and EV. maybe you've got to add another 15 to 20 pounds for EVA things like the TMG and EV gloves and advisors. The shuttle EMU suit doesn't exist without the life support system. So there's no, because the heart upper torso is part of the pliss in a way, because it has a lot of plumbing inside of it to be compatible with the PLUS. I think the total combination was the two was like 220 pounds I believe I don't know you remember Ronnie? I guess 250. Yeah yeah 220, 250. So the Apollo lunar suit? Apollo lunar suit? Without the backpack? I think it was 180. This is a gross check, I mean, but I think it was about 180. There's an operations handbook. It's in that. It's in our specs, in master end item spec. Every data pack had a suit weight in it. I mean, the weights are everywhere, and they vary. But there's a master requirement, was an upper limit spec that all hardware had to make. And that went down to the glove, helmet, visor, lunar boots level, LCG, comm care you would expect. Because we purchased parts of the suit independently of other parts, and part of the acceptance test was to measure the weight, and it had to meet a spec weight requirement. And we had to report weights to the program office every month in a report. I mean, weights were controlled. And the ASDP suit configuration became about because they wanted to reduce the weight of the suit as well as other things in the command module to accommodate launching the docking module to the Soyuz. So weight will always be a problem. I know we looked at use of, Joe Cosmo looked at use of the advanced suits, which he always worked on, for use on the moon. Every time the issue came up, it was how do you package it, volume-wise, and how heavy is it? And it shot it down every time. You know, the suits with lots of bearings and lots of hardware. Just too heavy. and no place to put it inside the command module or the LEM. The volume was a penalty that you had to meet. Well, thank you for being such an attentive audience."

So my name is Cinda Chullen and I manage the United States Spacesuit Knowledge Capture Program and it's a real privilege. I've been involved with it for nearly eight years now and we had quite a hiatus last year. We lost our funding but with some great investments on the two programs that have supported us in this effort. One is the JSC knowledge capture management office has helped us with getting Jim in and And they've actually signed a contract with him to provide us with six sessions this year. And this session in particular that you're going to hear today is divided into two sessions. So we're really going to get seven sessions out of Zoom. So we're very excited this year about having this session. And then also I'd like to thank the NESC for helping us because they are sponsoring Vladinka to help me administer the program this year. And I'm very thankful to Hank Rotter for doing that this year. And the focus for their investment is to allow us to make these knowledge capture events public. We are working very hard. Villadinka is working very hard with the NESC, and we'll have our sessions recorded and archived with the NESC. and they're going to be very special in the sense that they will be not only synchronized with the lecture and the presentation, but they are going to be closed captioned. So people who can't hear will be able to watch them and read the words on the videos, which is just awesome. And so I'd like to thank both of those programs for helping us. And as well, our EC5 branch is supporting me and allowing me to continue to do these programs. So this year we have, I guess the first thing I need to let you know is that we have released, I think it's nearly 33 sessions have been approved out of the 66 that we have done so far over the last eight years, have been approved for public release. And we already have many of those sessions available through the NASA History Office. And so if you go to the History link, you can access 30. Well, we don't have all 33 with them. All 33 has been approved, but a large portion of the 33 have now been archived. I think at least half of the 33 have been archived with the History Office. So now, you can, relatives and people and vendors and contractors can listen to these videos from now on as long as they remain in the public domain. So I'm very excited to have Jim here today with us to give us a wonderful lecture and start the series for this year. And so what I'd like to do is tell you a little bit about Jim. He is, I've gotten to know Jim since he started doing lectures with us a couple years ago. And I've just been amazed at Jim's career in spacesuits. And so we're very, very fortunate to have him with us. Jim McMaron comes from a long legacy, really has become a legend when it comes to spacesuits. He started out in his early career as he was going to college at the University of Dayton. He was studying in geology, but he got involved with some work efforts that were going on at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. And there they were doing pressure suit research. And so Jim got involved with that, and shortly after he graduated, you know, his career at NASA was forever to be in space suits. And so he spent nearly 40 years at NASA working on spacesuits that ranged all the way from Mercury to stations. So he's literally worked on every program that NASA has worked on, and he has been a part of that as a spacesuit expert. He's held various positions, all the way from chief engineer for extravehicular activity to managing the entire branch that works on spacesuits for NASA. And so after he retired, he didn't stop. He continues to consult. He worked for ILC for a while. And then when he really retired, he decided to work for himself. And so he's been consulting, and that's what's led us to him as well. So he continues to do research in spacesuits. And hopefully, I think you're working on a book eventually, right? I hope so. So, I'm just delighted to have Jim here today and I just would like for you all to give him a great hand and give him a good NASA welcome. Thank you, Jim. Thank you very much. I'm sitting here today because I've got a lower back problem and I stand too long and I get pain and I don't want to have any pain while I'm talking to you for sure. This is the fourth session that I've presented here and it's been my privilege to do that and I thank you very much, Cinda, for the nice introduction. The other three sessions that I completed range from Mercury, Gemini and the early Apollo block two spacesuit competition where the ILC suit was selected for use in the Apollo program. The agenda today, which is one of two sessions, is going to cover a minimum amount of early spacesuit development because I really didn't work in all of this particular area. Part of this time I was working on the Gemini EVA system for GT4 and Sub. But I'm going to give you a little background on that, which I think is important for you to understand. And the next part will be the five different types of requirements that was utilized for the Apollo spacesuit development and certification and use in the Apollo 7 to 14 missions. Also I will cover the impact of the Apollo 1 accident where we lost three flying friends and crewmen and also to end up with the discussion of the redesign that occurred to the a6l suit that was actually used on the Apollo 7 to 14 missions in the early part of the program the Apollo EMU which stands for extra vehicular Mobility Unit, which is a combination of the backpack plis and the suit, was awarded under a competitive procurement to Hamilton Standard. ILC became the subcontractor based on the selection criteria that NASA used. However, they were not on the proposal team with HAM Standard. So NASA sort of forced a combination marriage, if you want to call it that, between Ham Standard and ILC for the development of the EMU. However, this didn't work out too well for multiple reasons. One was the prototypes that were developed under this early contract were not found satisfactory by NASA for various reasons such as leakage, excessive leakage, mobility, comfort, ability to get up, stand up after falling down and as a result this program became seriously late in the eyes of NASA management and and they wanted something done about that. And these were the, some of the, most of the suits that were developed under this combined contract. And I'm not going to get into the details of these, but they were all different models that were developed serially under that contract and found unsatisfactory by NASA. And then by NASA I mean the NASA astronauts, the NASA Crew Systems Division technical personnel, and the NASA management that was in charge of the program. So as a result of that problem, NASA established an in-house competitive test program to try and find a better space suit for continued development"

So as a result of that problem, NASA established an in-house competitive test program to try and find a better space suit for continued development. Now I reported on this program in the last session that I presented in detail, But I thought I'd give you just a little bit of information about how this test program was conducted. It evaluated all aspects of the suit from design, function, operation, man-suit interfaces. Test conditions were controlled with a test team that evaluated and emphasized all of the mission requirements. and there were 65 separate different tests that were subjected to the suits that were part of this evaluation. And as I said, this evaluation can be found in the Apollo Block 1 session that I previously provided in January of 2013. These were the three suits that were subjected to the test program, And the AX5L, as it's called, shown here. Whoops. Let's back up a minute. Get used to this. The AX5L here, which was manufactured by ILC under a company-funded activity. They took the best of what they knew, what was resulting from the early development under the EMU contract with Hampton Standard, and developed this particular suit. The other two suits were the AX-1C, developed by the David Clark Company, which was a prototype outgrowth of the Gemini suit and the Apollo Block I suit development that was funded by NASA to support this evaluation. Finally, the AX6H was submitted by HAM Standard under company funded EMU contract and had support from the David Clark Company for part of the effort and BF Goodrich for part of the manufacturing. Details of this are covered in that previous presentation as I mentioned before. Dr. Gilruth, who is the center director, provided details of this evaluation for continued development of the Apollo EMU to NASA headquarters, Dr. Mueller. He recommended three changes not consistent with the previous EMU procurement plan. One, to amend the existing EMU contract with HAMPS standard to only cover the portable specialized support system and associated equipment. Second, award a new separate contract to ILC for full development, manufacture, test and delivery of Block II flight spacesuits and associated equipment. And third, which is an item that many, not too many people today understand and know about, he assigned the NASA Crew Systems Division responsibility for block 2 EMU program implementation which included management overall management overall systems integration and conduct spacesuit qualification program for for the program the basis for this decision to change the procurement plan and his recommendation were the result of that competitive suit evaluation, a reassessment of capabilities of ILC, a team of NASA engineers and managers went to ILC and conducted a detailed inspection of their facilities and capabilities, personnel and organization, and the previous lack of success of HAMS standard and affected an adequate suit total system development effort. However, However, he did recognize Ham's standards, competence and excellence in the portable life support system work. So then in September 1965 it was announced that NASA would negotiate with IOC for a contract to develop the Apollo Block II spacesuits. At this point in time, this is what the EMU contracts looked like. Under Hamilton's standard, they would develop the PLIS, which included all controls, displays, and emergency oxygen system, shown here, oxygen system and the portable oxygen system. All the remainder of the suit, which is a worn part from the waste management system, the EVA visor, the thermal, meteor, liquid cooling garment, constant wear garment, and pressure garment assembly was provided for under the ILC contract. At this time, NASA management felt that it was necessary to expedite the procurement of the competition suits, prototypes, additional models, and a cost, a letter cost plus fixed contract was awarded to ILC to immediately start work on providing additional suits. At that time NASA procurement started on a sole source contract NES 960-100 for full development of all the contract end items development production training and flight suits and of course implementing all the Apollo program configuration quality reliability requirements. In this contract also was to provide all field support, field personnel at different sites and spare parts. This was an incentive award contract based on schedule, cost, and technical performance. Under NS 95332, which was the first immediate action contract, Modifications were incorporated in the AX-5L competition suit based on the results of the competition findings and recommendations of NASA technical personnel. 10 A-5Ls, as they were called since they were production units, were delivered to support immediate Apollo Block II program needs. Suits were provided to North American Aviation, which became Rockwell. Suits were provided for lunar module development at Grumman. Development suits and components for testing at ILC. For development support of the PLIS and operational port system at Ham Standard. And in addition, one of the concerns based on the evaluation during the competition was the reliability of the pressure ceiling closure, which was part of the configuration of the suit. So four suits were made and delivered to the U.S. Army NATO labs for reliability cycle pressure testing to determine the reliability of that pressure ceiling closure. In addition, suits were delivered to NASA Johnson Space Center for astronaut simulators work development and training development support. And finally, suits were given to the NASA Crew Systems Division for development testing and interfaces verification as they were needed. These suits were all developed and manufactured and delivered under Class III controls, which means they did not have released engineering, they were not built to full inspection and quality control, but they did meet minimal engineering requirements that were imposed and found acceptable by DCAS inspection that evaluated each of the suits when they were delivered. Under NAS 960-100, training and In flight suits, CEI's development production certification was accomplished with full implementation of NASA quality and configuration controls. It incorporated modifications to the A5L baseline based on the results of interface testing conducted at the various NASA contractors and at JSC. These changes were incorporated and established the A6L training and flight CEI's design. By CEI I mean each of the components of the suit like PGA, LCG, EVA, gloves, lunar boots, etc. In addition, the contract included all spare parts, repair materials, familiarization and illustrated parts manuals. personnel from ILC to operate and participate in the suit activities at both the Manned Spacecraft Center here, Johnson and I, Kennedy Space Center, North American, Grumman and Hamilton. We had technicians that could operate the suits at all these sites at that point. Now to get into the first of the five different types of requirements. These are the contract delivery requirements that were imposed on NES 9-6100. Provide custom sized suits for all mission assigned astronauts. One training,"

These are the contract delivery requirements that were imposed on NES 9-6100. Provide custom sized suits for all mission assigned astronauts. One training, one flight, and one flight backup suit was provided for the prime crew and one training and only one flight suit was provided for the backup crew with training suits provided 12 months prior to flight and the flight suits six months prior to flight and the backup suits for the prime crew three months prior to flight one item that not too many people know about is that there was a star code identification process that was used to manufacture some of the mission assigned crewman suits to protect their identity before they were officially released in the NASA system. This star code system, people that were aware of the codes were my supervisor Charlie Lutz, myself, the ILC program manager, and the ILC chief pattern maker who was responsible for the customization of the patterns that were used in the suits for manufacture. This system worked very well and not and these names actually ended up on some of the labels of the suit components. So I know the Smithsonian people have asked me different times you know who who is cannabis or who is so-and-so and I still have that code and I'm I'm the only survivor of that three of four people that knows that there were three certification test suits made one for design limit endurance cycle testing to be conducted at ILC one suit for environmental exposure testing at NASA Johnson in conjunction with the portable life support system and for portable life support system and OPS interface testing at HAM standard. The contract requires personnel, ILC technical personnel, to support 2TB1, which was a command module thermal vacuum test over in chamber A, thermal vacuum test of LTA8, which was the LEM module in the thermal vac testing, to support command module on a LM pre-flight vacuum test conducted at KSC, interface tests conducted at KSC like C squared, F squared, crew compartment, and functional tests, and actual to support launch and at MSC during the mission in-flight analysis and technical support. So that was a basic summary of the contract technical requirements. The lunar landing mission requirements required that the crewman pre-breathe in the suit oxygen to prevent the bands before lunch. So the pre-breathe activity started in the suit room at the Cape and followed the crew member all the way to the launch pad insertion into the command module and launch. The suit was worn during all unpressurized mission phases. Now, that was a requirement. Now, as it ended up, the suits were only worn during partial mission phases as reliability concerns sort of were satisfied and it was felt that it was capable to do that by the command module and the LEM. In addition, it was required to operate decompressed in both command module and LEM in free space with the capability to exit the LEM on lunar landing, perform surface exploratory activities, examination surface, and return safely to the LEM. A backup 30-minute short-term emergency protection was provided for external EVA, as it was recalled, prior to in the Command Module M modules in event of spacecraft failures and support a 30 minute contingency return time to the module. In addition it was required to operate the spacecraft in unscheduled cabin pressure loss. That means all the controls and displays in what we referred to back then as a hard pressure suit, a hard space suit. was 150-hour transit period in a hard suit pressurized suit from a lunar surface to a safe Earth atmosphere should both the LAM and a command module not be repressurized during ascent of the LAM to the command module, inability to maintain pressure in the seals docking with the command module and the command module being decompressed all the way back to the earth. That is another requirement that we satisfied by actual man tests of suits where we had subjects this was conducted in a hospital in Dayton Ohio with people I was familiar with where we demonstrated that a crew member pressurized in a suit could survive for up to 115 hours. That's quite a feat that not too many people were aware of. Also to perform all the task activities on a lunar surface. These included egress of course from the LEM down the ladder or pole to the lunar surface to conduct lunar surface walking up to a mile, visually inspect the LEM exterior, remove, TED-UP experiments, adjust and operate instruments, and the capability to bend or kneel down to collect samples and to walk or climb over lunar obstacles and carry heavy objects. These activities were defined to be required in 1965 prior to the first lunar landing. Environmental requirements are listed here I would refer you to the Apollo EMU master end item specification which specifically identifies the details for each of these requirements shown here as you can see is quite an extensive list of requirements that the suit and the suit CEIs are subjected to for certification these were the lunar surface environmental conditions that were required the suit to be certified to which was conducted in vacuum chambers 1 6 gravity simulator thermal vac testing and for the suit micrometeorite impact testing of suit cross-sections to demonstrate that it had the capability to survive the environment on the moon and in terms of the visual requirements the lunar day with a high Sun which created a visibility problem without adequate protection these are the interface requirements quite an extensive list which we we certified the suit to of course the atmosphere approximately 100 oxygen at 5 psi pressure which was the command module and LEM ECS required conditions for the modules. For the command module couches and a LEM landing and launch restraint system the helmet had to have a capability with the crew member pressurized to operate all navigation and optical systems provided by Draper Labs. This resulted in eye relief requirement for the helmet design so that they could get their eyes in direct contact with the optical instrument. Command Module M functional equipment transfer and storage. Command Module M PLIS and ground communication instrumentation requirements. PLIS restraint straps for LEM egress. The activity on the the moon and LEM return ingress. This is an important one. A crew vacuum transfer capability between all the modules and the portable life support system without loss of suit pressure. This impacted the number of connectors on the suit so we could affect a pressurized suit transfer between systems with no leakage during this transfer. Also, a crew member self-connect, disconnect, and reconnect capability for all PGA connectors. That PGA is the suit part that contain the pressure, and that's where the gas, water, urine, and electrical connectors. Also, self-operation of all necessary command module, LEM, and PLIS operations controls. Visibility necessary to see the displays that were required in all suit conditions in the command module, LEM, and on the PLIS. Provide the capability for urine transfer to the command"

Provide the capability for urine transfer to the command module and LEM. related to the 115R pressurized return capability and to provide a medical injector application for hard suit or pressurized suit application in the event the crew member needed a medical treatment. And of course at the end of the mission post water landing survival equipment such as a neck dam, life vest and flotation capability for the crew member in this suit. The design requirements for the individual contract end items. Pressure garment assembly. Of course, the operating pressure was 3.75 plus or minus 0.25 PSI. That was selected to maximize suit mobility with the technology that existed at that point in time. 6 psi proof, 8 psi structural and 10 psi burst pressures for the PGA. Important for the life support systems was the pressure drop across the suit from inlet to outlet connector of 4.7 inches of water with a command module or LEM gas flow rate of 12 cubic feet per minute. with a diverter valve open on the suit there was a diverter valve and I'll show you that in a minute the red diverter valve which allowed the flow in the suit to be can to be half to the helmet and half to the rest of the body or with the diverter valve closed all the flow to the helmet to remove co2 in a helmet and the EVA mode leakage less than 180 cc's per minute at both vent and operating pressures of course a reef valve would open on a suit at 4.1 psi an event of a failure of life support system or command module lamb ECS system helmet co2 less than 16 millimeters of mercury at a metabolic rate of 1600 BTUs per hour. It required a lot of testing to verify that we have that capability in all test conditions, both at ground level and at vacuum and at thermal vacuum. A helmet mounted feed port for in-suit nourishment. Here again, this is related to provide both water and food tube nourishment to the crew member in the event of 115 hour pressurized return. Or in-flight if he needed drinking water or nourishment of cord hands dexterity and fingers tactility to operate all the controls and tools to do the job that he was expected to do adequate helmet vision for all mission interfaces in different mission phases post landing water ocean immersion that meant that when the crew member disconnected from the connectors it would not allow water to flow into the suit which was a problem on Gus Grissom's Mercury flight if you recall and of course a four-year shelf life from the date of acceptance test at the contract facility the four-year shelf life was based on the fact that we used rubber materials both natural rubber and neoprene rubber in the suit and we required for your life from delivery of the product thermal microd meteorite garment was a self Don and Doff jacket and pants that was worn separately over the rest of the suit or torso limb suit assembly this provided the suit the PGA torso limb a suit assembly with thermal and micro meteorite protection separate jacket and pants that was the a6l configuration ev gloves with the dexterity and fingers tactilely to operate controls and knobs of course the 250 degree grasp capability for tools and scientific experiments on a lunar surface and to provide abrasion scuff and cut protection for the basic pressure bladder and the glow lunar boots required to be self-donned and doffed worn over the basic PGA boots for all lunar surface activity and to provide a 250 degree F plus or minus surface thermal protection to the boot and feet. In addition abrasion scuff and cut protection for the PGA boots. The LCBG had an operating pressure from 9.3 to 19 psi. Proof pressure shown burst pressure 47.5 psi. Again it had a pressure drop requirement to meet to be compatible with the LEM liquid cooling system and the portable life support system liquid cooling system. Water tubing was provided over the arms torso legs. Approximately 180 linear feet was the length of the tubing in a liquid cooling garment. Over the feet were socks only. It had a very minimal leak rate of water at the nominal operating pressure of 19.5 psi and a temperature of water at 45 degrees F. The LCG provided water cooling during suited LEM and both and lunar surface activity and it provided a attachment provision for the biomedical instrumentation that was required to be worn on each crew member. Again the EVA was self donned and docked, had a thermal collar that was providing protection around a neck ring of the helmet during EVA. It provided visual, solar, thermal, micrometeorite and supplemental helmet defog and impact protection. It required to be required to provide adequate field of vision and either sunlight or darkness and to provide supplemental helmet defogging capability. It did that by minimizing the heat loss or gain into the helmet during night or daytime EVA. mostly nighttime EVA when the temperature of the helmet went down significantly. Constant wear garment that was worn inside the command module and during normal mission phases covered the arms, torso, and legs sort of like underwear and it provided an attachment provision for the biomedical instrumentation. The comm carrier was GFE2ILC from the David Clark company. Initial models of the ILC comm carrier design was found inadequate by NASA and David Clark offered superior design for consideration which was accepted and found to be used used for the suit in block two. It went here again had self donning and doffing requirements, capability to attach to the electrical harness in the suit and it can provide a redundant microphones and earphones as well as wiring to the system used in either command module LEM or the PLIS and the electrical harness for connectors between the suit the comm carrier and the Biomed instrumentation sensors the waste management system the urine collection device provided in-flight storage of up to 950 cc's per minute in the suit and the capability to transfer fluid from inside the suit to the command module and storage containers. That capability primarily was a pressure drop between the command module and LEM systems where it was at a lower pressure to take the fluid from the suit into those storage containers. The fecal containment system, FCS, was required to provide 115 hour pressurized return capability. It was a garment that was like a diaper, only a more comfortable type. It absorbed body fluids, contained feces during both unpressurized and pressurized suiting conditions and had a capacity of 1,000 cc of feces. again was 114 hour requirement bad times for NASA the Apollo 1 accident which occurred in January in 1967 where we lost three crew members they were wearing block one spacesuits manufactured"

The next day we received that direction. No manned testing were to be conducted in an oxygen enriched atmosphere by contractors. All man testing in an oxygen enriched atmosphere would be performed at NASA facilities only after successful completion of an operational ready inspection conducted by a team of appointed NASA personnel. We were to identify and eliminate all ignition sources in enriched oxygen atmospheres. Of course, the pressure garment assembly was an enriched oxygen atmosphere. Remove all flammable materials from oxygen-enriched atmospheres, with the exception only when no suitable material replacement was available. And then these exceptions were to be documented by a material use agreement, which was to be presented and approved by the Apollo Program Change Board, at the time run by Dr. Lowe. At that time, this was the status of the Apollo 6L PGA and CEIs. CDIs were completed the year prior, 1966, where materials, parts, materials, drawings, ICDs were all reviewed, approved, and documented. The first article configuration inspection was completed the same month as the accident. At that time documents and specs were approved, hardware design configuration was approved, and manned demonstration of the suit and all SIM items were conducted in a review conducted at ILC. In terms of hardware production delivery, cert suits and CEIs were delivered at that time. Man endurance cycle testing was underway at ILC with the A6L. And that same month, man testing at vacuum was being conducted at JSC. Joe Kerwin was a test subject in a chamber that was conducted that same period of time. well as unmanned environments testing and all the CEIs were underway at JSC and the unmanned thermal chambers and training CEIs were in production. This was the A6L PGA and CEIs design baseline at that point in time. The PGA, this is a configuration which would have flown in the command module and then prior to donning the jacket and pants extra Hickler visor EV gloves and lunar boots and adding on the plis and the oxygen purchase this would have been the configuration flown in Apollo block 2 prior to the Apollo 204 accident. This is a redesign that took place to the a6l PGA's as a result of that. The torso limb suit, the formal separate jacket and packs was abandoned and the TMG was integrated over the arms legs boots of the suit a non flammable TMG cover layer materials cross-section was incorporated boot soles of the PGA were changed from neoprene to a non flammable floral material all the interior TS TSL torso limb suit assembly materials were approved by a materials usage agreement because there was no suitable replacement materials available and identified and within the technology capability at that point in time. The helmet, the polyurethane impact pad was covered with beta cloth material on the inside of the helmet. The exterior polycarbonate material again was approved by MUA since there was no suitable replacement. The IV and EV gloves had integrated cover layers changed to a non-flammable materials cross section and the thermal insulation added with chromal arm material over the EV and glove fingers and poly for abrasion and cut protection which were identified to be needed during the endurance testing that had been conducted on the A6L. This is the A7L PGA design baseline. helmet with a replacement vent pad with a cover of beta cloth. Integrated TMG. Neck dam provided for post landing water survival and when a helmet was removed it could seal that next section of the suit. Two sets of gas connectors inlet and outlet, a liquid cooling garment connector, electrical connector, cover over a LEM restraint bracket that was installed for the LEM restraint system, a protective cover over the urine transfer fitting, there were pockets for pencils and utility items, boots covered all the way down to the boot sole and of course I mentioned the floor L boot sole this was a configuration worn inside the limb and the command module during normal mission phases this is a ventilation system that shows how the different inlet and outlet connectors were configured there was a valve right here that could be switched that would require all flow to go to the helmet to provide co2 washout in event are not in event of but for EVA when the diverter valve was open flow flowed from the suit up to the connector and out to the outlet connector pressure relief valve located here boot vent system all the way to the bottom of the boot it was found during thermal vacuum testing of the boot and PGA that we needed ventilation on the bottom of the feet to provide adequate temperature control for the feet during walking on a hot surface of the moon. Here you can see the helmet with the cement pad and flow. This is a pressure gauge that provided the crew member the opportunity to know what his suit pressure was we had ventilation flow down past the wrist disconnect into the hands for some ventilation control for the hands this is a material suit cross-section starting with the on the inside the liquid cooling garment which was worn separately proceeding to the nylon comfort liner that was worn on the inside of the pressure garment assembly for donning ease to the pressure retention layers the convolute or ripstop nylon to the inner neoprene night ripstop material which was a barrier for micrometeorite penetration the super insulation thermal control consisting of laminate and Kapton Marquisette which was a non flammable material that provided the protection to the suit and the outer layer of the suit of beta cloth non flammable beta cloth and chrome LR scuff patches that were located on the shoulders and areas of high wear where the crew member was wearing the plus straps on the suit. These are the contract end items the the EVA gloves configuration with the chrome LR that provided the scuff and abrasion protection. The fingertips were changed to a neoprene not a neoprene an RTV 630 silicone that provided the thermal protection for the ends of the fingers. This is a cross section that shows a super insulation that was mounted on the inside of the glove, the nylon webbing that provided a restraint for the wrist and the neoprene coated nylon up to the finger cap. Inside the silicone finger caps there was super insulation as well. This is the lunar boots with this with the restraint strap the donning assist strap and it had the chromelar fabric we didn't know what the lunar surface condition would be when we first landed on the moon.

We didn't know if we'd be running into very sharp objects or surfaces so we had a chromelar and abrasion fabric. We had an RTV silicone boot sole for thermal protection and scuff protection. Inside the boot was again the thermal insulation and the outside was beta fabric, non-flammable beta fabric. On the EVA, the exterior red polycarbonate On the EVA, the exterior red polycarbonate shell and visors were approved by an MUA, again, a materials usage agreement, since there was no substitute for polycarbonate. In addition, it was stowed during normal mission flight in an unflammable container. The CCA and EEH had current limiting requirement from the command module, LEM, and PLIS into the suit to eliminate any possible ignition source. This required an extensive amount of testing to establish the amount of current that would be allowed that would not allow ignition to occur with the non-flammable suit material that was wrapped around the electrical harness. And that material was Teflon. It contained earphones, microphones, and wiring that was required and approved by materials use agreement. And that again was no suitable replacement and it was stowed in a non-flammable container when it was worn. This is the EVA. It may not look familiar to what most of us consider would be the EVA on the lunar surface and it's not. was the Apollo 9 configuration EVA that was flown on Apollo 9. At the time of Apollo 9 we were conducting certification tests on this unit for lunar surface application and found that the red polycarbonate shell deformed under high temperature and had to be covered for protection. And I'll get into that when I talk about the redesign for the subsequent missions from Apollo 9 in the next briefing. This shows the protective visor, the sun visor made of polycarbonate, the protective visor made of polycarbonate, the polycarbonate shell cable connection that connected and held a collar around the PGA neck section in place. This was referred to as the EVA, Exterhicular Visor Assembly. Comp carrier, there you see the Teflon material that was used, the non-flammable material that covered the complete shell and microphones and ear cushions and the cups for the chin, cuff and wrist and attachment. Constant wear garment worn inside the suit. Materials were approved by MUA. It was a cotton material and no suitable material was found to worn inside the suit. We actually looked at a beta cloth, constant wear garment material, but it was found to be too itchy to the crew members and was not found acceptable. So we went to the change board and got that approved. Likewise the liquid cooling garment materials approved by MUA, there were no substitute materials for that. it was stored in non-flammable container. The waste management system again had no suitable replacements and when not worn inside the suit was stored in a non-flammable container. This is a view of the liquid cooling garment, the A6L liquid cooling garment with the Biomed harness, the urine collection device being worn. Underneath the liquid cooling garment was a fecal containment system and the material next to the crew member's skin was spandex which allowed for a tight fit around the body and Tygon tubing used for circulation of the water to provide the cooling and conduction with the LEM or ECS cooling systems. This is my chart that shows the whole assembly of the suit to be flown on Apollo 7, except for the EVA, which I showed you previously. And it shows the helmet with the non-flammable material pad, the integrated TMG, all the on the boots the gloves telemetry system liquid cooling garment some of the equipment that was worn on the outside of the suit and a water flotation life vest and the comp carrier that is my last slide for today I'm here to answer any questions you may have and if time runs out you can always submit the questions to send if you think about them later and I'll be happy to answer them for you. The next briefing will be covering certification and the mission, each mission configuration and experience from Apollo 7 to 14. I broke this up into two parts due to the magnitude of the charts and the time available here to provide the briefing to you. Later I have in work the Apollo 15 to 17 missions which use the A7LB spacesuit configuration which was different significantly from A7L. Modifications to the A7LB for the Skylab program. for the Apollo Soyuz project, development of the shuttle EMU for initial space shuttle program flights, not all the flights but the initial flights, and the initial spacesuit development for the space station program with the shuttle EMU. So that's all I have for today. I appreciate your time and any questions? Yes sir? I will take all 20 minutes. Okay. The neck dam on chart 30 you showed the neck dam for use in the water if the helmet was off. Was that a separate item? That was a separate item. It was stored in a pocket. And when it opened up it had a metal band around it that the crew member could insert into the helmet. It just pulled over like a turtleneck essentially? No, it actually attached inside the ring of the neck of the suit, just like the helmet did. Okay, and you showed the red polycarb, the shell for the EVA visor assembly that was used on Apollo 9. Was the insulation in development or in work at that time, or was that opposed to Apollo 9? At that time, we had testing underway to test that particular configuration for the lunar surface environment conditions. And it was during that testing we found that the uncovered red polycarbonate was not acceptable. However, it was determined to be acceptable post-flight or afterwards for the conditions in orbit of Apollo 9 that did not go to the moon and only had the normal Earth orbital thermal requirement. Okay, good, good. Good, thank you. Okay, next? Yes. Can you give us an idea about how many people were involved in ILC, Hamilton Sun Strand, in the group initially? I'm trying to see how big the program was. There were a lot of people, and I have to give them credit for making possible all this data that I presented to you. For example, during this period of time I was a section head which had eight engineers working for me that was assigned responsibility for different parts of the suit. There was a thermal test branch in crew systems that ran the chambers and their contractor, I don't know how many people but there were quite a few if you know how many people it takes to run a chamber test in chamber A or B or the crew systems at that time we were running chamber 8,"

I'm trying to see how big the program was. There were a lot of people, and I have to give them credit for making possible all this data that I presented to you. For example, during this period of time I was a section head which had eight engineers working for me that was assigned responsibility for different parts of the suit. There was a thermal test branch in crew systems that ran the chambers and their contractor, I don't know how many people but there were quite a few if you know how many people it takes to run a chamber test in chamber A or B or the crew systems at that time we were running chamber 8, 8 foot chamber. I do know how many man months per month were expended at ILC during the program. I think it reached a maximum of some 400 man months per month that covered the manufacturing of the suit personnel at JSC I think we had about approximately 50 engineers and technicians at JSC at the time I think we had about 26 engineers and technicians at KSC we had two technicians at Rockwell we had one technician at Grumman. We had one technician part-time on and off at Ham Standard when he was needed. Does not, I can't tell you how many people might have been involved in crew training at the time, but there was, you know, this was a big program. The cost of the NAS 960-100 for the this program from Apollo, Skylab and ASTP was about 62 million dollars in then year dollars, quite a bit more today. And at the end of the contract we had a million dollar underrun. And that was a 10 year, over 10 year period. Yes sir? I remember growing up as a kid I had this major Matt Mason action figure space suit guy and he came with a very odd accessory that was kind of a meteorite protection suit. I also saw that on the cover of Life magazine. It was like this big cone that you put around him with little windows in the side. Do you remember any of that? We never used any of that in this program. I'm familiar with what you're talking about. There were a lot of artists and different people's perceptions of how you would devise a suit for a man to walk on the moon. And that was one of them. There were several others as well. Some developed it at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and different contractors, Westinghouse, genodynamics, they all had proposals. And if you have any of the first correct editions of Collier's Magazine for the first space station and first lunar mission, they have some of those in it as well. So they never went into any kind of testing? I'm not familiar with them ever being developed and used. Also, there's a very good book put out by the Smithsonian on spacesuit development and operations. At the end of each mission, after our post-flight testing, we provided and sent to the Smithsonian all the flown spacesuit equipment. And they have the complete inventory of everything that was returned back to ground as their responsibility. And then they loaned them out to different museums, but we didn't want to be part of that activity. turned out all over Smithsonian. That's where all the flight equipment is accountable to, and of course they've dispersed it. I don't know where it is all now. Any other questions? Yes. You have, not to spoil your next talk later on, but you have Apollo's suit development for Apollo's 15 to 17 missions. Correct. That's a different suit. It was a suit that was developed to provide waste mobility that was required for the lunar vehicle on the moon surface. But there were also Apollos 18, 19, and 20 that were canceled by the Congress, right? They were canceled. So were there suits? Is it actually Apollo 15 to 20? They hadn't been started yet. Yeah. Okay, so they hadn't started fabricating those suits yet. Crews had been identified, but they hadn't started manufacturing yet. Yes? So, for clarification, the A6L with the mods became the A7L. Correct. So, the A7L was the post-fire version of the A6L. Correct. For the PGA. For the PGA. Things like the LCG and some of the other items carried the 6L designation since there was minimal modification. That was a major change from A6L to A7L in terms of the documentation and the engineering controls and design. And that's what created the model change. But things like the LCG are minimal change that we kept the A6L. Yes, sir? You mentioned a two-inch pressure drop in water for the airflow at six cubic feet per minute. What was, with six CFM, was that the maximum airflow you had in the suit or would that vary whether you were on the vehicle or the police? In the vehicle, both the command module and the normal CFM that we were required to design was 12 CFM at the 5 PSIA ambient in the module. Okay, that's what it was designed for. And at that point we adequately removed CO2 plus provided body cooling. That's why we had the two types of vent systems in the suit. Did I answer your question? Yes you did. And then the 6 CFM, that was if you were on the PLIS? That was on the plis, correct. Thank you. Okay. Any other questions? Yes, sir. You mentioned the PGA leak rate requirements. I was wondering, is there any specific part that leaked the most on the suit you had a problem with? The biggest problem we had with the suit was the pressure sealing slide fastener that ran from the crotch up the back to the back of the neck. We found that usually took a maximum of three closure replacements before flight on some suits. And it was due to nicks in the closure lips, which were minor but still exceeded the 185 cc per minute requirement. I have a chart I'm going to present in the next session that shows you the actual leakage rate post-flight and pre-flight for each of the suits that flew on all the missions. 14, I mean 7 through 17. I have that data. You know, most of these details that I presented to you are from my memory, and I assume it's correct but I may have some flaws in it, minor I hope, and from my personal data. I have a pretty extensive collection of data that I have kept and plan to turn over to the University of Houston library when I finish with all these sessions. And that's in collaboration with our history office at NASA. Yeah, because I have all kinds of reports and data that I'm drawing from. You saw some of the actual sketches and photographs that I used in the presentation from my files. I just want to point out here there's a gentleman here in the group that was responsible for the suit in the early part, Jerry Goodman, who did a very good job back then.

And he has a wealth of information on those early suits and participated in that and from I can tell did a good job so and I recognize Dr. Clark here's quite an expert in this field and has worked with high altitude balloon work successfully very good any other questions yes you mentioned the requirements for mobility and dexterity. What kind of issues did you have trying to meet those requirements? The issues were, well if you if you recall the suits were custom made to the crew member and the requirement that we levied in a contract on the contractor for sizing to provide maximum mobility was that the contractor take the measurements of the astronaut they take the hand moles of each astronauts hand and maintain that as an official contractor record and that we would send send an astronaut to the plant for a fit check prior to government acceptance of that crew member's suit and equipment. And if the astronaut was not satisfied with the fit check, it was not accepted and he had to rework the suit, which in some cases they did. Primarily there was adjustment of cables. don't realize that some of the suit components were based on a size system like convolutes. There wasn't a custom made convolute for each joint. They were several sizes of convolutes but the actual assembly of the correct size convolute was done at the factory as part of the customization before delivery. And once the suit was sized properly and all the cables adjusted properly, the suit was extremely mobile and different than if you go over here to Building 7 and take a suit out and put a crew member in and see how mobile it is. Well it's not the same as what it was fitted for an astronaut that was built for and size 2 at the time. And that's what made this large number of man months I referred to was we had quite a production set of personnel, production engineers, production inspectors, production laborers, seamstress, dippers. I mean, there were a lot of people involved. Yes, sir. So were all the suits one-time used or were any of them reused? We had some reuses for training. Not for flight? Not for flight. It was a policy that the flight hardware was taken and given to the Smithsonian for historical purposes. But training hardware and flight suits that were not flown might be reused by a crew member on a subsequent flight, if it's the same crew member, or if he was close enough in size that we could go back to the factory and resize it to fit that new crew member, which we did on several occasions. And those records are pretty sparse right now, I must say. Yes, ma'am? What were the requirements of the electric harness for the A7L suit, and is that still worn and with the same requirements for the EMU suit? When you say requirements, there was redundant wiring. Or just the power requirements, so like how much power did it supply? Let me take an action to get that for you. You're looking for the power that was allowed to be a non-ignition source, right? Okay. I think it was 0.5 amps. Okay. Or 0.005 amps. I'm not sure which, so I'll have to check that. You don't remember, do you, Jerry? I don't. And the voltage across. But we did an extensive amount of testing with the electrical harness to show that there was no ignition, to define what the ignition current would be to start a fire and what was acceptable with the ending requirement. And I'll get that for you. I'll give that to Cindy. And is that harness still in use? There's a report on that actually that I'd recommend you to go to. There's a NASA record about this thick, I have a copy of it, that identifies all the tests and test conditions and results to establish the requirement. And you have to be careful with what we did because it was based upon the atmosphere that we used, the materials that were used in a wiring as well as in the contact with the wiring. So you just can't take that number like.5 amps and apply it across to a new suit development. need to test with the atmosphere that you're going to be subjecting the crew member to if it's a higher pressure atmosphere that would affect the result and what would you require okay if I get you that report Cindy can you make a copy of that report if I get it to you okay that's that's the best thing to do I'd be afraid just to give you a number and say that's what I should use again in the future. Because there's too many conditions that could be a variable and I wouldn't want you to do that. Any other changes you would have liked to have made to the suit or given the advancement of materials, anything you would do for the next suit, wavering back to the moon? Yes, absolutely. We would, in fact, when you look at the shuttle RFP, procurement of the shuttle suit, we specified some don't use things like cables and swedges. Don't use company proprietary products. Okay. Okay we did like the dipping compound for the convolutes and glove bladders was a proprietary compound. I would extend the age life requirement. We think we did that. We found the helmet configuration to be very good for CO2 washout, visibility, and defog capability configuration we used. And that's why we recommended it and used it in shuttle of course. I can't think of any other. I think the cables and swiggers were a constant problem. not use a pressure sealing slide fastener. And we didn't in the shuttle EMU. We used a pressure sealing slide fastener made by BF Goodrich in Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo. During the Mercury program, when I was running the Mercury suit program, I went to BF Goodrich because we were having problems with leakage. and it's a proprietary designed and manufactured product. Okay. And they gave me a tour of the facility where they manufactured closures and it was extremely dirty, uncontrolled in my mind. And we tried to get them to clean up their act and fix their processes and they would not do that because it was a commercial product which they sold lots of and our need was small in terms of quantity. So they did agree that they would do an extra detailed inspection on the finished product before they delivered them on our purchase orders which we used in Mercury, Gemini and Apollo and did solve a lot of our problems. But if you go out and get a commercial BFG slide fastener you won't get the one we used. An interesting story the Russians purchased back then it was Soviet Russian Russians purchased 50 slide fast"

An interesting story the Russians purchased back then it was Soviet Russian Russians purchased 50 slide fasteners from BFGoodrich for use in their program we think I'm I know know they bought 50 and they returned them to go up BF Goodrich says they were defective and inaccurate you know unusable and you can see evidence of cycle wear and tear and so that was interesting they went to a different they didn't use that closure design at all and even in Soyuz or or their Orlan suits Because it's, structurally it's fine, and like in the ACES and ACES suit we used in shuttle, but the reason it's okay is because it allows a large leakage rate before failure is considered. Failures of leakage were small. I mean, we had a small leak rate requirement, 185 cc per minute. But I think the ACES suit and any suit where you have a ventilation inlet flow to pressurize the suit, you know, leakage is not a big issue before failure. Yes, sir? It says in your bio that you were a member of the space task group at Langley. Correct. So I was curious, and that's after you graduated with your undergraduate degree. Correct. How you got that job at Langley as part of the Space Task Group? I've only known the Canadians, the Avro boys that came down that were part of the STG. When I was working at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base on a contract with the University of Dayton to provide test subjects, I tested all kind of suits and pressure suits. And I was involved in the testing of the conditions for selection of astronauts for the right stuff, You know, all the medical tests, tilt table, centrifuge, and all kind of tests. More than I can remember. But one set of tests that I was selected to be a test subject for was selection of the Mercury suit for NASA. And when the suits were delivered, I didn't fit the suit. I was too tall. Okay, but I ended up being a test subject, testing those suits. And at that point in time, I met Dick Johnson. and he was in the process of establishing the crew systems division, at that time was the life systems branch, personnel to support his suit activity, and he asked me if I'd be interested in a job. And that's where we started was at Langley. The original NASA space task group is where the Mercury suits were out of. So I moved to Langley from Dayton in June of 61 to start working for NASA. And I thought I'd be a technician, because that's the kind of work I was doing at Wright-Patt. And I was called an aerospace technologist, and I was put in charge of the three technicians that run the suits for NASA, Joe Schmidt, Al Rochert, and Clyde Dink. So I went to the Cape for all the flights and oversaw the activities at the Cape for suit checkout and assertion and what have you. That's where I started. Any other questions? Getting personal now, but okay. Yes? Two questions. One, I thought I remember hearing it was difficult on one of the Apollo missions for them to get out of the hatch. I don't know if that's, I assume y'all would have done ground, human in the loop testing. If you're referring to, I can't remember the crew member. We had a crew member that didn't open the hatch properly or couldn't open the hatch properly on the limb, which delayed the EVA start. and I think there was a piece of something stuck in the hatch. I don't recall all the details. It was just a one-time case. It was a one-time thing, right. And I think it was, I don't remember who it was. The limb went from a round hatch to a square hatch though, right? To accommodate that, I thought. I'm not familiar with a change to the limb hatch from the first mission at all. But we did have a problem of opening the hatch on one of the early missions. Too tight, difficult to get out. Yeah. The second question was on that 114 hour return case. You mentioned something about a hospital. I guess you all did some ground testing. Yeah, Miami Valley Hospital, they planned it. And did they do the urine, fecal matter, sitting in it for 114 hours? They took and had eight test subjects live in a suit for 100, actually went over 114 hours. And they tested the fecal containment system and the urine system and provided nourishment through the Pelmet feed port. At one time I had a test report of that and I have lost it and I wish I could find it back. I don't even know if that exists anymore. more. They talk about doing the constellation, doing the Orion, you know, lunar return. They talk about that 114 hour case too and there's a lot of... We tested for it with people. They talk about trying to separate the waste, fecal matter and just kind of hazards that would bring on if you were sitting in it for... As a result of the testing we did at that hospital, we redesigned the fecal containment subsystem somewhat and found that we required an ointment for the crew members to apply as an option for skin protection and it was provided with the FCS and in storage and whether or not the crew members used it I don't know they were told that why they should use it and I never got any feedback after the flight so I guess those type questions we didn't ask I think maybe the medics did, we didn't. Did they don both of those on for every EVA? Yes, they did. As far as I know they did, I mean they're supposed to, okay, whether they did or not, they didn't tell us otherwise. Was there a way to remove any of it during that 115 hours or was it? It was entrapment of the feces and absorption of liquid. Some of which escaped into the lower half of the suit. And, of course, you could change the vent flow to all helmet only if necessary. I don't think we ever did that. We never had to use that requirement. I mean, we had it available if needed. Any other questions? Yes, ma'am. For the pressurized suited crew member transfer between the CM and the LM, Was that based on if one of them couldn't be pressurized or depress? One of the modules could not. If the crew members were out on the lunar surface, here's the condition that was required"

Crew members on the lunar surface, pressurized suits of course, they come back to the LM and they couldn't repressurize it. The seal failed or whatever. So they had to launch ascent to the command module in orbit wearing pressurized suit at pressure. And assuming when they got to the command module the tunnel hatch between the command module and the land wouldn't seal properly once you were in the command module. And the command module was depressed. and you had that capability for the return of the command module to the Earth atmosphere and post-land. We also had a requirement to go from the command module into the lunar module on a hose, intravehicular. Correct. IVA transfer. For IVA transfer in through the tunnel between the command module and LM. There were umbilical connections in both. Yeah, and personal umbilical. Long umbilical, where you could get in and operate controls. Anything else? Very good. Let's give them a big hand. Thank you. Thank you."

She has, I've known her her whole career and I have been honored that she has been so dedicated to this subject. She has worked for NASA for over 20 years and she has dedicated pretty much her entire career to the development of the portable life support system. And in particular she's specialized in such fields as the metal oxide and some individual components and that. So today you'll get a nice treat. She's going to give you the overview of the PLISP, but she's also going to cover some of the development over the history and the technology. So you'll get a feel for what has gone on in the PLIS over the last two decades, especially of her career. But she's also, not only does she have the experience to brief you today, she has quite a bit of an extensive background in education. She has her bachelor's degree from University of Houston in mechanical engineering, and she has a master's degree in space studies from University of North Dakota. And so with that, I'd like to give you Gretchen Thomas. Thank you. Yay! Okay, so this is a portable life support system, or PLIS 101. So that you guys will appreciate the complexity of the PLIS, I want to emphasize really that the space suit is a vehicle. It's a miniature one-person vehicle. And because of that, it has to have all the functions of the shuttle or the space station. Everything that they provide, we have to provide, but we have to do it in a highly integrated system that's independent of the vehicles. If you, I'm not talking umbilicals at all today, so if you are attached to an umbilical, obviously you're not independent, you're dependent on your vehicle. So to be a PLIS, you've got to be independent, you have to be mobile, it has to be portable, of course, and it has to be highly reliable because our system is so small and compact, we can't afford the redundant systems that an ECLSS system has on the vehicles. It's got to be compact and lightweight. And even in zero gravity, it still has to be lightweight because the astronaut still has to move that mass around. It takes a lot of energy to get it started and to get it stopped. So even though you don't weigh anything technically in zero G, you still need to keep the mass of the total system low. Alright, and so to do all of that, we have two categories of functions in the list. One is the basic life support function. This is what it takes to keep a person alive. You have to regulate the soup pressure. Of course, you have to have soup pressure out in vacuum because you need to be able to inflate your lungs and to keep your blood from boiling. You have to provide oxygen for breathing. We use 100% O2. don't have to, but using 100% O2 means that you can operate at lower suit pressures because you only have to do the sea level equivalent pressure, which allows us to operate around 4.3 psi, which increases your mobility and your comfort in your spacesuit. It's also easier to manage than an air mixture because if you're using a nitrogen-oxygen mixture, balancing that over time with the suit leakage and the CO2 that you're adding in and pulling out is very difficult. So we use 100% O2 in the suit, and then your other major area of life support function is to remove the metabolic byproducts in the suit. We breathe out, we produce carbon dioxide and humidity, we put out waste heat as our muscles work, and humans put out trace gases, odors, particulates, and we have to remove those from the suit volume as well. There's another area of functions of a PLIS, which is separate from those life support functions but just as critical. We have to do system control, obviously. Everything's electronic. We have to control it. We have to monitor it for safety. You have to let your crew member know if there's a problem so that they can go in. One of the reasons we don't have to have a fully redundant life support system is that if there's an issue, we can provide a lifeboat with our secondary oxygen pack, and we can get the crew person back into the huge vehicle. and then of course everything is powered and we have to provide communication even though we're independent isolated or independent we don't want to be isolated we want to provide communication. So it breaks down like this so we we can basically divide the plis very easily into subsystems. We have our oxygen subsystem and we use a primary oxygen system to store the oxygen and that you regulate it. And then we also provide a secondary oxygen system as this lifeboat function I was talking about. If something goes wrong with your suit, you want to have enough time to get back in the door. We have a ventilation subsystem, which consists of your CO2 and humidity scrubber, your trace contaminant control, and then you have to have a way to circulate all that. So you need a fan, and then we have to monitor the performance of your system. So our two most critical sensors in the system are the CO2 and the vent flow sensor just to ensure that everything is properly functioning. And if any of those indicate we're not, then it's time to get back in the door. Then our third subsystem is the thermal, which includes a liquid cooling garment, which we share with the suit. They own the garment. I always joke with them. They own the garment and I own the water. So we have in the past done cooling of crew members on Gemini. They used just vent flow and it wasn't adequate enough to remove cooling from the crew members. And so, but way back then, our clever engineers came up with this liquid cooling garment and it actually works the way your body's sweating works and it removes that heat from the surface of your skin and it's very efficient at cooling. We send that warm water from the liquid cooling garment into a heat sink. I'll talk about specific technologies in a few slides. But we have to have a heat sink, a way to reject that heat. You could do environmental radiation, just let the person get cool from the environment. But on orbit in zero gravity, your environment changes constantly as you rotate around the Earth. And it's a control nightmare to be able to do that. So what we've chosen to do throughout the decades is insulate the crew person very, very well from the environment. and that way you minimize those effects, and then all you have to do is provide cooling inside the suit. And then to get all that water pumped around the loop, we need a pump. We actually use a venting, water venting systems, both in the existing suits and in the future suits. So we have to have a water tank to replenish our vented water, and then you have to have some heat exchangers to cool the vent loop and then to cool the electronics in the system. Then under the power category, we use battery power. You could use fuel cells. You could use other types of technologies. But then you have to step down that voltage from your main source and do power conversion and"

But then you have to step down that voltage from your main source and do power conversion and power distribution to all your electronics. In the avionics arena, we have a radio, a caution and warning system, and then data processing, the instruments that monitor your system. And then what do you do with that data? You know, how do you push it around the loop with a computer? And then another system in our plith, which is oftentimes overlooked, but I think we've done a very good job the last decade or so telling people, letting people know that the structure and the packaging of the suit is a technology in itself. Anybody who works on computers and cell phones nowadays knows that miniaturization is an art in itself. And so that's what we're doing in our structure and packaging. How do we attach to the suit? How do we provide protection for all of the equipment? And then how do we miniaturize that thing into a compact system? All right. So let me talk a little bit about space architecture. The space suit architecture, we've been using the same space suit architecture for 30 years. And in the PLIS, we've been using the same architecture from Apollo. Our life support system, I've got some details coming up. I'll tell you about that. some comparisons, but we basically use the same life support system from Apollo to early shuttle to station now and The the Russians also use the same Technology that we've used over the years and so everything that we're doing currently in advanced technology is trying to get those systems better more capable smaller lighter weight and Be able to operate on planetary surfaces So, as you guys are all well aware, we don't have a mission currently, except in general terms. We have exploration objectives. NASA doesn't really know where it wants to go yet, but we do know that it's going to be beyond LEO or lunar or Mars. There aren't really a whole lot of choices. And so you can see there's a lot of similar objectives among the three. And so what we're trying to do in our development world is to concentrate on those objectives that will take you to any of these places. And beyond LEO, of course, it's zero gravity, but we have very, very cold environments, high radiation environments that we have to deal with. The short mission duration isn't new. That's the way we're currently operating. But we'd like to get regenerable systems that are more efficient on crew time. If we go back to the moon, the way we were planning to do in constellation, of course you're going to have long duration missions. You have to deal with dust and fall protection. But you'll, again, you'll see some of these similar objectives crop up in multiple missions. And then in Mars you have a CO2 atmosphere that you have to deal with. Much longer term use, higher gravity, so a lot more lightweight technologies are needed. And again, dust and fall protection. All right. So here's the historical comparison that I was going to tell you about earlier. So in the Apollo EMU, the total system weight was about 115 pounds, and I'm talking just the plis now and not the suit. It used a sublimator for cooling where we basically expose water to vacuum and it sublimates off of a plate and provides that heat sink for your liquid cooling garment. In the shuttle we're also using the sublimator technology. In the lunar and constellation world and then what we're carrying forward into this new generation of technology development is a water evaporator. It works very much like the sublimator, but we don't need the high level of vacuum in order to evaporate through a membrane the way that we do on the sublimator plate. and that way this technology will work on Mars as well as lunar. The beauty of this system is it also doesn't care about dirty water, so we'll be able to use the potable water, and we're looking at more robust pumps. On the regulator side, we've always used mechanical regulators in our systems. We're currently developing electronic regulators. The technology has gotten good enough that we can do that, and there's a lot of advantages to that. Oh, I'm sorry, that was the feedwater system. I was talking about this line right here. On the feedwater system, we actually used regulated feedwater in the Apollo and the shuttle EMU, and we have chosen to put our water bladder, our soft water bladder, inside of the spacesuit and drive that water pressure with the spacesuit pressure, and so that eliminated a very complex system on EMU that is the feedwater regulator system. Alright, back to CO2 control. Lithium hydroxide is what was used on Apollo in early shuttle days, still used on shuttle some, but nothing beats lithium hydroxide for CO2 absorption. It has the highest capacity per pound of chemistry and it's great. The problem is it's not regenerable. And so even though it's only a six pound, six and a half pound canister, you have to replace it every EVA. So what we did in the early station days was we developed a metal oxide system. Silver oxide weighs 32 pounds compared to lithium hydroxide which is 6.4 pounds. It's basically the same capacity but it is regenerable and in a reasonable, it has a 100 watt basically a hot hair dryer. Blows through the canister at 100 watts and regenerates the canister in about 14 hours. For the future though, we're trying to look at on-back, trying to develop some on-back regenerable CO2 chemistry, what we call a rapid cycle of mean, and I actually have a description of that that I'm going to show you later, so I won't go into a lot of detail on this at this point. In the heat exchanger world, to cool your vent loop and to remove the humidity in Apollo and Shuttle, we were using a condensing heat exchanger and then removing that condensed water out of the loop through a kind of complex slurper system. On our new systems, the RCA actually does water removal for you and so we don't need a condensing heat exchanger but just a non-condensing heat exchanger to take the sensible heat out of the vent loop, which again simplifies our system. The Apollo and Shuttle systems use low pressure primary oxygen, high pressure secondary oxygen that aren't on orbit regenerable. For the mission sets we were looking at, we really needed to get a rechargeable"

The Apollo and Shuttle systems use low pressure primary oxygen, high pressure secondary oxygen that aren't on orbit regenerable. For the mission sets we were looking at, we really needed to get a rechargeable secondary system, and so we chose to set our primary and secondary oxygen settings at 3,000 psi. And then I already talked about the regulators. And then buddy capability. In Apollo, they actually had buddy cooling available. If the cooling system went down, they could join the PLCIS together and share cooling. Shuttle does not have that. We were implementing that on the constellation suit, but we've deleted it in our current activity because that's a very big driver for our architecture. And because of funding constraints, we decided not to tackle that. So this is what a PLIS schematic looks like. So I'm going to take a few minutes to walk you guys through the schematic and kind of explain how this system works. I'll start up here with the oxygen system. And over here in green is our primary oxygen system. You store your oxygen in the tank, run it through a two-stage regulator. The first stage steps the pressure down from the 3,000 to some intermediate pressure, 150-ish PSI. And then the second stage regulator steps it down to your suit pressure. And then it feeds into your ventilation loop. This line here is for recharging your oxygen tanks on orbit. The secondary system, again, that's your lifeboat. in case of any type of emergency, your system is shut down, your secondary oxygen will kick in and allow you to get indoors safely. It can make up the purge valve or a small hole in the suit for about 30 minutes. Allow you to get back in. The system in gold is the ventilation loop, and we'll start up here. Okay, so your oxygen comes in here, flows into your suit over your helmet and over your face to get that CO2 washout from your helmet and to provide some cooling around your head. It flows through the suit and is picked up at the extremities, the arms and the ankles, or the wrists and the ankles by the liquid cooling and ventilation garment. Then it flows back out into our pliss and goes into our CO2 scrubber. So the CO2 scrubber that we're working on currently is the rapid cycle amine system. I have a really cool graphic here I have to show this because it's cool. So anyway this is how the RCA works. It's a two bed system that they the beds switch back and forth. So the first time you're operating on bed B your CO2 and your water vapor come inside get absorbed by the amine pellets your clean oxygen goes back out into your vent loop. Then the bed switches and while you're loading up bed A, bed B gets exposed to vacuum and is regenerated. The CO2 and water vapor leaves and then it switches back and forth and alternates. You know, the cycle time on that valve is 2 to 5 minutes, 2 to 8 minutes roughly. And then it's continuously regenerable and there's no limit, there's no longer any time limit on your EVA duration based on your CO2 system. Is that cycle time dependent on metabolic rate? It can be. It doesn't have to be. What our, in our current system, we are planning to measure the CO2 and cycle the bed based on the CO2 level, how hard you're working metabolically. That will allow you to get your bed actually smaller than if you do set a constant cycle time. So, a little more efficient there. Okay, so we've come out with our clean air, clean oxygen. We run it through a trace contaminant filter. On the MU, they use just activated charcoal, and we're going to need something a little more than that because this bed here tends to off-gas tiny trace amounts of ammonia, so we have to be able to take that out. So I'm not sure what this will be yet, but it will be more than charcoal. The fan pumps are flow around the loop. We have two CO2 sensors, one that measures your CO2 here coming into the loop and one that measures your CO2 here coming out of the loop just to make sure your system is operating properly. Runs through our vent loop heat exchanger, through a vent flow sensor and then back out into the suit once the oxygen, the make up oxygen is added. Okay, so then in our thermal subsystem, let's see, I will start here. We pick up waste heat in the liquid cooling and ventilation garment. The water comes through the plis, is pumped out through the heat exchanger to pick up the waste heat in the vent loop. Then it's pumped around the loop. We have another heat exchanger to pick up the battery and electronics waste heat. And then this is our SWIMI, spacesuit water membrane evaporator. This is another new technology development item. And I also have another cool graphic on this. So this is how the SWIMI works. Our SWIMI system is hollow fiber membranes that are permeable to water vapor but not to liquid water. So the water flows through the system, and you get some amount of water evaporated from the hollow fiber membranes depending on the back pressure of the vacuum in the system. Okay. So depending on how far this valve is open dictates how much water evaporation you're going to get. If you close it completely, you won't get any water evaporation, and your water will stay warmer. So when they're working in very cold environments or at very low metabolic rates, you don't want as much cooling in the system. And then because we're evaporating water, we do have to re-add the feed water to make up. And that, as I mentioned earlier, is actually stored inside the suit volume now, whereas in the shuttle and the Apollo systems it was not. It was in a tank in the backpack. Okay, so that's my PLIS. That's the functional schematic. Now I'm going to spend a few minutes talking about our architecture and the packaging and the things that drive that. Some of these architecture requirements drive your schematic as well, but it mostly drives your packaging. Things like whether or not on-back recharge is required or can you recharge back in the vehicle. Do you have to remove the PLIS IVA? The shuttle EMU was not originally removable IVA. It was modified later to make it IVA removable and maintainable. The Apollo system was IVA removable. They actually took the plisses off and threw them out the door before they came home, which is really sad. It makes me cry when I think about it. So they're laying on the"

It was modified later to make it IVA removable and maintainable. The Apollo system was IVA removable. They actually took the plisses off and threw them out the door before they came home, which is really sad. It makes me cry when I think about it. So they're laying on the surface. In our consolation program, we actually had to be EVA removable, so we had to tie the suit in. I'll show you some pictures here in a minute of how we did that so that you could keep your pressure garment pressurized with an umbilical and dump your pliss. Whether or not you have buddy mode available is also a driver. And the environments you're operating in, the thermal environment, the gravity, and whether or not there's atmosphere on the surface like they have on Mars. The funny thing about the Mars atmosphere is it's CO2, and it turns out that the CO2 is almost the same level of pressure as your CO2 that you're breathing out. And so in the RCA and in some of the other technologies we looked at, these venting technologies, we used that driving pressure between the CO2 in your system and the zero partial pressure of CO2 in the vacuum to regenerate that and drive that out. Well, on Mars, they are equal, and so there's no driving pressure. So we have to come in and modify some of these systems to use sweep gas or some other type of technology that drives it off with heat instead of with pressure or that type of thing. So it's tricky. It can be tricky. And then there's other things. We have to deal constantly with how we interface with the suit, the pressure garment, whether or not it's waist entry like the Shuttle EMU, whether or not it's rear hatch like the Mark III advanced systems. We have to stay out of their work envelope and their visibility. Of course, we don't want any PLIS components interfering with our crew members' primary function, which is to go out and do work. And then there's vehicle constraints that we have to consider. One of the things we're doing right now is trying to make a system that's compatible with Space Station because that's the only vehicle that we have to operate on. And so that is dictating a lot of changes in our schematic from what we were doing on Constellation to what we'll be doing in the future. And then whether or not your vehicle is constrained by volume or up mass. Shuttle is a very water-rich vehicle, so all these systems that vent water, it's not a problem for them, don't care. But in the future, we may have vehicles that aren't so water-rich, and we may have to go away from the water-venting technologies. And then up mass was not as critical for station as it's going to become in just a few months when we're no longer flying the shuttle. Okay, so what that means is really doesn't affect your schematic. It does affect your schematic, but not nearly as much as your packaging. So I'm going to show you two examples of that. I'm going to show you what we're currently working on as far as packaging concepts and then what we were working on under constellation. And you can see there's kind of an infinite number of solutions on how you tie all this stuff together. And it really just depends on what's important to you. So in today's environment we're working on a PLIS that would be compatible with a suit port and station, as I mentioned earlier, with the station resources. So what that drives us to is something that's very tightly packaged, low volume, very low profile. We have a very tight constraint on suit port, the door that we have to get fit through, and then how big we can be so that they can open the door inside the suit port vehicle. And that has driven us to traditional hard structure mounting so that we can cram everything together tighter and it doesn't move around a lot and it's not a lot of volume for access for maintenance. We've also eliminated the vacuum removable requirement so we no longer have to run our connection on the outside where a crew member can access it. So we're running our connections through internal pass-throughs through the hatch. This is the Mark III hatch right here. I didn't give a good view of the inside of it, but this curved surface here is the Mark III hatch, which is the advanced suit. And then this is the motherboard that all the PLIS components mount to, and we've actually integrated them into one piece. And an alternative concept is what we were working on in Constellation. and we were going back to the lunar surface, and we were very concerned about weight and maintainability, being able to access all these components for 100 EVAs and keep everything working well. And so we were going with a foam-protected PLIS and support system where we could spread these components out. We could fall on the lunar surface and not worry about damaging our components. It was very much the concept of the way your TVs and your stereo equipment come packed, you know, in a foam cardboard box. And we had the vacuum removability requirements, so instead of running through the hatch, we had to have this external multiple connector that was EVA crew member accessible. Because we wanted to be able to remove the plis and drop it on the ground or stow it, we used an Apollo-esque type soft strap. The Apollo system was actually just strapped on like a duffel bag, you know, the traditional backpack with soft straps. And so we were using that same kind of concept again. And then this is another view of that, a little bit different version. If you compared the two, they're not exactly the same, but it's all iterations on that same concept, and we actually built it up and drop-tested it. And we also had higher CG constraints. the CG was becoming very important through we had learned through other testing that was going on around the center. Okay so I that was pretty much my talk on on PLIS stuff but I wanted to go now into a little history because most of you guys I consider you to be new if you weren't here in the 80s and 90s like myself and Heather and I think Robert Trevino is our only other person that was around doing tech dev in the 90s then you're new in my mind so I wanted to take this chance while I have you guys all here captive to kind of give a timeline, a history of our technology development so that you'll get an appreciation of how far we've come to get to where we are to make these decisions on RCA and SWIMI. It's been a long road. So I'll start with the 80s. Under Space Station Freedom, that was the first opportunity that we had"

It's been a long road. So I'll start with the 80s. Under Space Station Freedom, that was the first opportunity that we had since the early 70s to develop a brand new space suit. Space Station Freedom had very severe non-venting requirements. They said, you guys cannot sublimate, you can't put all these nasty things around our sensors. Of course, it doesn't seem to bother them now, but in the early days of Space Station Freedom, they really thought they were going to have a lot of critical sensors outside that they didn't want contaminated. So they were driving us towards non-venting solutions. They wanted to conserve resources. They didn't want to have to launch, you know, 100 lyocanisters a year. That would be an entire shuttle just full of nothing but lyocanisters to support EVA. And so we were severely up mass constrained. So we started looking at all the non-venting technologies. We brainstormed everything we could think of. The beginning of this was before my time, but I did come in in the mid-'80s to work on some of this stuff. Cinda, remember, she worked on some of this stuff too. In the thermal world, we started looking at auto cooling control as a way to conserve resources so that you weren't overusing your water. Then we started looking at a vapor compression heat pump, which is your basic air conditioning system. We looked at ice pack, phase change materials like a wax radiator system that also use thermoelectrics to regenerate afterwards. We looked at a metal hydride heat pump and a radiator system. In the CO2 scrubbing world, we also looked at non-venting solid amine absorbers and a pumped liquid membrane contactor. It was a membrane system that allowed the CO2 to soak through the membrane into a chemical sorbent, cesium hydroxide, and then you would pump the cesium hydroxide around to a regenerator to get the CO2 out. Not real time. You would do that after the EVA. And then we started our first look at metal oxide absorbers. And at that time we were also looking at higher efficiency fans, an air bearing fan, fuel cells instead of batteries because they're easy to recharge. And then we were also looking at some information, helmet mounted displays, voice recognition was coming on the scene. So we evaluated some of those things. And then we took some of these technologies and actually created what we call the integrated energy management system. It had an HCCS, a solid amine, and a fuel cell, and a hydride heat pump kind of all integrated together. So that was our first look at system integration. Okay, then in the 90s, Station canceled a new suit because they got into budget and schedule problems. And they said, oh, shuttle EMU, we'll just do life extension on it. It's fine. So they canceled the station EMU development, and we went into exploration technology development mode. So in the exploration world, we started to think beyond station, going back to the moon, and, of course, we had requirements that were size-constrained, mass-constrained, and really thinking about long-duration missions. We're going to be on a planetary surface for a year. So we also, what we learned in the non-venting technologies is they are huge. The systems that we were putting together at that time were on the order of 5 to 6 cubic feet. The shuttle EMU is about 3 cubic feet and they were 300-ish pounds. So to use non-venting technologies is not really practical for an EMU. They're just too heavy, too big. So once the constraints were off us to do venting, we were allowed to do venting systems, we started looking at some of these things. We took the metal hydride heat pump and we cut off the storage part of it and we let it vent the hydrogen gas and cut its weight in half. We started looking at things like gas gap and freezable radiators, composite radiators that were lighter weight. We did our first version of SWIMMY in the 90s. We looked at a segmented LCG, which would allow you to get better control of your heat removal. Maybe you wanted more flow in your legs when you're walking on a planetary surface than you wanted on your arms. and we were looking at things like piezo and magnetostrictive water pumps, which would be more efficient, more reliable. In oxygen world, we started looking at liquid oxygen because you can store liquid oxygen at a much lower pressure. They're safer, and then you could also use the heat, the heat of vaporization of the liquid oxygen to give you a little boost on your thermal control system. So we started looking at ways to do lock storage and lock acquisition. In the CO2 removal world, the metal oxides were coming along very well. We did another two versions of the metal oxide. So we're on the third generation by this time. And then we ended up actually getting it mature enough to replace the Lyo with the metal oxide system. and that happened around 96 to 98 time frame. So now we have a regenerable system on orbit and solved our launching lyocanisters to station problem. We did at that time look at cycling amines, but they were too immature, and we thought it was way too much risk, and it turns out that was the right decision because I don't think we could have ever got the cycling amine system to work on orbit in the time that station needed it. We also looked at cycling molecular sieves, zeolites, but the amines are much smaller and have less issues than molecular sieves. We also have started looking at membranes, permeable membranes that could vent the CO2 and the water vapor overboard and just directly through a membrane the same way the SWMI works, but with CO2. And we started looking at thin film composites and then immobilized liquid membrane composite systems. We did a second generation fuel cell, and then we also started looking on the system integration side. We put together multiple schematics. One was a C-PLIS, cryo-PLIS, and one was an M-PLIS, which was a minimum consumables PLIS, and one was an S-PLIS, which was shuttle-compatible resources. And then along that same time, we started looking at multiple packaging concepts. How can you more efficiently package stuff, get the weight down, be more maintainable, and that type of thing. so there's lots"

How can you more efficiently package stuff, get the weight down, be more maintainable, and that type of thing. so there's lots of concepts floating around at that time. And then in the 2000s, of course, most of you guys are now coming on board, so you should be familiar with a lot of this stuff. We did our second generation of SWMI. We started doing our aerogel thermal insulation. We looked at a liquid cooling and warming garment because we had the cold crew member problems on the orbit. We did a second generation pump. We started the oxygen regulators recently, the electronic oxygen regulators. In the CO2 and humidity removal world, we looked at a bioenzyme membrane. Membranes are tricky. They really have not panned out to be what we were hoping for. There's too many issues, but we are still looking at them. We looked at cryogenically freezing out CO2. You can use liquid oxygen through a heat exchanger and freeze your CO2 out. and that was interesting. I think Heather worked on that one. We looked at a temperature swing cycling scrubber instead of a pressure swing bed, and then we started looking at photoionization and laser decomposition of the CO2. That was one of my favorite things but didn't work out because it turns out CO2 decomposes into carbon monoxide and oxygen more readily than it ionizes, and so managing the carbon monoxide in a closed vent loop is not a good thing. So that didn't really work out. In the power side arena, we started looking at zirconia cell, electrolysis for power, and PEM fuel cells. And we tested hardware. We got hardware and tested every one of these items that I'm talking about. And I have the reports if anybody's interested in any of this technology. I've got them in my files so you can see our design and test reports. But they all have issues. You know, none of them, well, some of them have promise, but the direction that we went with RCA and SWIMI, a lot of these you can get them to work, and then some of them have more promise but don't really fit our mission set, our mission profile. And then we also were looking at more information systems. We did a time-modulated ultra-wideband radio on SBIR, Small Business Innovative Research, and that actually worked out really well, and I gifted our radios to EV, and they're playing with them still to this date. I think they use them in desert rats. We also looked at the electronic cuff checklist. A lot of you guys may remember when we were doing that effort, trying to get more information up to our crew members. And then, of course, that brings us to now. So I already talked about the swimming and our robust pump and our electronic regulators and the packaging, and then that's it. And then, of course, we're looking at high-density batteries and heads-up displays, which you'll hear in a future knowledge capture when our Glenn partners talk about those things. So that's it. Any questions? That's a lot of material. I know. I'm sorry if I didn't go too fast. All right. No questions? I'm sure we have at least one question. Who wants to be the first? Yeah, because, I mean, this is a knowledge capture event, and what you're doing is you're setting the stage for people after you to come, and so they won't have Gretchen to ask questions in the future, so you can ask for them. How's that, okay? I have a question on dust removal in the suit here on another surface. Do you have any way to mitigate that? Not yet. The dust on those surfaces are very abrasive. We have looked at that kind of stuff in the past. It's not really a plis function, but Lindsey has worked on some stuff, and then Luis Trevino, one of our recent retirees, was also working on. They looked at air showers and brushes. I think Joe Cosmo did a lot of some laboratory experiments with brushing the suit off. Did you want to add anything to that? There's a lot of ideas out there, and we've tried a lot of them. Not me personally, but our group has. What works best? So far. Brushing? Brushing. Danadome. Mm-hmm. So, and then, of course, when you're looking at vehicle design, you would have maybe a grading system where you can, you know, like your front porch where you can go and stamp it off. Hi. So one of the things I was impressed about was the beautiful simplicity of RISC-O-Matic as compared to the previous Plisses. I just wanted to know about any challenges or the effort you took to create that simple schematic but still maintain the redundancies and fault tolerance and all those things. So part of the genesis of that is that a lot of the people who were working with me, my early mentors in advanced technology development, were the folks who designed and helped get the Apollo and the Shuttle EMU up and running. and those were the things they hated about it. You know, it was so complex. We needed to separate the water loop. We needed to separate from the vent loop, and that would remove a lot of the failures that we saw in the early days. And so they were kind of on a crusade to do that. And then when some of the technologies came along, like the RCA that could do CO2 and water separation together, you know, we jumped on it, and we really attacked that because it was such an elegant solution to our problem. Things like using metal oxide in a future system doesn't remove, it doesn't absorb water, but we did look at desiccants. That probably should have been on my list.

That probably should have been on my list. We did look at regenerable desiccants to absorb the humidity instead of using a condensing heat exchanger. So I think it's mostly because of the people that came before, and they knew the issues, And so in a technology arena, that was really what they wanted to do was to get rid of the things that were causing a lot of problems. Just another question. I guess in my mind, maybe it's my mentor's old school thinking of sort of this fear of having a more electrical system from a reliability perspective. Just wanted to know if you could talk more about that. Yeah, we had some people who were uncomfortable with that at first. And even now, I mean, there's a small argument against that because a mechanical system usually has to work unless there's some kind of really weird failure to it. Or even the non-moving systems like the solid, the pack beds of Med-Ox and a Li-O canister has no moving parts. But electronics have gotten so good and reliable and our cars use them and our planes use them. And as the technology in the world and everybody's daily life gets better, they get more reliable. And so they're more able to satisfy our reliability concerns. And one of our biggest naysayers in our group was Colin Campbell. That's why he is now the regulator developer. We're like, Colin, you hate it the worst, so it's yours. So he's getting rid of all the stuff that he hated about it. So, and now he's like, I think he's almost converted. I know. It's all about how you choose it. So most of the time we have stepper motor interfaces instead of brushless DC. So if you have a mechanical regulator, for example, the stepper motor is only active during umbilical ops, for example, or if you have to change pressure after that, it's depowered, and it holds set point, for example. So it's not like it requires active power to maintain suit regulation. And a lot of that fear is generational too, like, you know, some of the younger kids around here don't even know how to use like manual door, you know, cranks. They're like, where's the door? How do we roll down the window? So the fact that everybody uses electronics and they've used electronics equipment since they were babies, it really gets rid of a lot of that fear and concern too. And then it's the technology is just better. So I guess going on what Colin mentioned, in a case where there is an electronics failure in the system, I'm not sure whether it's a sensor misreading or just a glitch, the way that it's designed would allow for the crew member to safely get back and get in. Yeah, yeah, it's how you fail-safe it. Like, for example, on the electronic regulator, which has an infinite number of set points, if you lose power, you hold your last set point and you use a latch, a mechanical latch, so that it can't close on you, it can't fail if it's not powered. Yeah, I mean, the primary and the secondary regulators are derived from the SOP regulators, so it's a two-stage mechanical system. And so only when you're altering the set point is the motor powered. So that particular case, you know, it's just going to act as a mechanical regulator. So it's an electrical system with mechanical backup. And the thing is, it's all based on your second string, which is the SOF. Everything fails. The current EMU fan fails. It's still an electric device that has to move the air out. So, you know, in that case, you fail, you go open looper. And so all those circumstances are built the same way. The SOF regulator, you're going to verify that it works before you get out the door. Once it's there, it stays open. And it's designed to fail open if it does fail. So. Female Speaker 2 Can we discuss a little bit about the usage of the long duration? So, you know, the power would be kind of one time mission and then space station would go out in a couple months maybe, but the moon it could be weekly. So how did you address that with the design criteria and how long would it take the PLIS to, you know, excuse me, recharging, how long would that PLIS be used? Well, our goal was to get like 100 EVAs and it's really a lot of that's material selection and just testing the heck out of it just to make sure that it lasts. Apollo used aluminum sheet metal structure and the shuttle because they knew the shuttle was going to fly for 20 years originally and now we're going to 30 plus I think. They use stainless steel everywhere. That's why it's so heavy compared to the Apollo suit. And so it's design choices that you make mostly in your materials. And then it's cycle testing, life cycle testing, just to ensure the robustness of it. I have a question. So you mentioned that you would need additional trace contaminant control, something more than activated charcoal to handle the ammonia that the RCA off-gas is. Has there been any thought as to, I mean, is that an easy problem to solve? Does that increase some complexity? Yeah, we've done a little bit of looking at it. Mallory did some looking at some technologies. What we really want is something that's regenerable. You can find chemicals that will absorb it, and then you just throw them away. But that's not an ideal solution, so we'd like to, through the technology world, go and find things that are regenerable. If we can't, you can always fall back on a disposable system. The shuttle EMU removes the ammonia in the system, which is put out through urine just by the condensing heat exchanger. And we don't have that. Of course, we got rid of that. That was one of our simplifying steps. But then it created another problem in the loop, because we can't get rid of the ammonia. Gretchen, I have one. You know, over the last two decades, you know, all these different And we've kind of narrowed those technologies down, you know, toward an integrated system now. Kind of picked the cream of the crop, so to speak. But now with the new change and the way we're doing business, potentially going to be doing business in the future, what are your thoughts on, out of all these technologies that we've looked at and kind of where the state is right now, what are some of the things that we can look for if we want to look at developing low TRL type technologies now? I would really like to go back and pick up some of our radiator work. Luis Trevino, you guys know him, he had some great ideas. The gas gap radiator was actually approved as a shuttle DTO, but then we never had funding to follow through on it. But it looked like a very great technology that would work. What it does is it has two plates in your radiator and you fill that center gap with a gas. and we were looking at using hydrogen because you could use a metal hydride to"

The gas gap radiator was actually approved as a shuttle DTO, but then we never had funding to follow through on it. But it looked like a very great technology that would work. What it does is it has two plates in your radiator and you fill that center gap with a gas. and we were looking at using hydrogen because you could use a metal hydride to absorb it and desorb it very easily as a control system. And when there was a vacuum gap between the plates, you would get no radiation, and so you could turn your radiator off, and then when you put a gas in between the plates, you'd get good conduction, and so then your outer radiator surface would radiate and you'd have to turn it back on. Constellation didn't say we couldn't vent as much water as we were venting, but they didn't like it. They would have definitely liked a better system that didn't use so much resources. So I would go back and pick up some radiator development. And then there's a lot of things in the schematic. The CO2 sensors, we're not currently funding any work on CO2 sensor development. And they haven't been very reliable historically because we operate them in a swamp. Most CO2 sensors used out in industry are in dry gases. gases and we are trying to measure CO2 in a hundred percent relative humidity and so that's a been a problem. CO2 scrubbers is the area we've done the most work on over the over the years. The swimming now is coming along very very well but I think that's probably those would be my top areas. I guess I have one other question with the SWMI being kind of drying the system out now how's the data looking to are we going to have to add anything back in for humidity control or I think that's still inconclusive on that they haven't finished the RCA testing with the there's different modes of operation of the of the RCA you can do a single ended desorb where you just expose one end of the bed to vacuum so you get the CO2 water out slower or you could expose both ends of the bed to vacuum and get that get evacuated faster so they're still doing this single-ended versus double-ended desorbent they're not sure if the if they can control the humidity better that way but our our last guess was we wouldn't need a humidifier so we did take it out of the loop because it was looking like we wouldn't need it. And part of that also included if we can make the LCG system not condense so much inside the suit, then you can send that humidity over to the RCA, and that would help you keep the humidity levels higher. So that's another thing that could benefit. If just the single-edged abusel doesn't fix your RCA, Yeah, Bruce and I found a very interesting thing that happens in the suit in the 90s. We actually kind of thought it would happen, and then we tested it and confirmed it. When you're exercising at very high metabolic rates, you're putting out a lot of humidity, so you would think your system would have to be sized for high humidity. But because your liquid cooling garment is running very, very cold, all that humidity condenses on your liquid cooling garment. And then when you stop working so hard and you turn to warm water, it actually re-evaporates. So it's kind of an inverted from what you would think was going on. And so that's what he's talking about is not getting so much condensation during the cold, high metabolic rates. You can get a lot better control that way. Are there any other questions for Gretchen? I want to make one comment if I could. Yeah, who's this? Here's a question from Glenn. Welcome. Hey, thank you. Under the dust tolerant question that was asked earlier, under our past work we had a task that looked at both dust tolerant connectors and controls. And we did a lot of work under controls, looking at rocker switches, capsule switches. We also looked at connectors so that we could potentially do a hot swap of the battery. This is to answer the 8 hour EVA question, which we don't really have enough power right now to do. And the question is could we hot spot the batteries out and continue on with the EVAs. So we also looked at both the connectors and the control issues from those points of view. Yep, great. Yeah, I didn't talk about the power and the avionics at all because I knew you guys were going to do a knowledge capture in the future. Right, we do have a knowledge capture that's planned that's upcoming in the next month or so that will be focusing on our power, avionics, and software, and that will be a 101-type lecture as well. And Mary had one more question. Yeah, go ahead. One thing I noticed was that the SOP was basically half the pressure as the previous SOPs. So it ends up being even bigger than the primary O2 tank. I was wondering what led to that decision. Yeah, on-orbit rechargeability was really the only thing that led to that. And, yeah, you pay a penalty in weight and volume because your tank has to get bigger. But you can't recharge 6,000 PSI safely on orbit. And 3,000 is kind of the upper limit, so that's why we picked 3,000. Okay. Where that can be safely done. And then we just set the pressure the same for both the primary and the secondary because there was no reason not to. Okay. So our primary got a little bit smaller and our secondary got a little bit bigger. We decided to go to one tank too. We could never really figure out why they used two tanks. I don't know. I don't know why two tanks. I'm sorry, what? Well, at 900 psi it's more, so it has to fit in the Ford Vector. So, and that's your question? Yep, and just thinking about, I can't honestly remember, the walk-back studies and whatnot, 30 minutes would probably limit the amount of travel the crew member would get from a roving vehicle. Yeah, so what we were trying to implement back on the Constellation Program was on-back recharge, where you could recharge both your oxygen and your water from the rover or little weigh stations that you left along the way. Or, you know, top off before you left the vehicle and went out on a mini excursion. So, yeah, we were looking at ways. And then what Rich was just talking about, the hot swapping the battery. The battery would, it's probably too large at eight hours right now. But especially if you had to do walk back, you would want to be able to swap out your battery and put in a fresh one before you left. So doing"

So that's a technology in itself, you know, to do that function. Okay. Our first goal is looking at doing it through an 8-hour EVA with one battery. Hot pumping is only a, truly a backup option. We really can't do it. We prefer to just keep one battery and go the whole eight hours with that PDA. Are there any other questions? I just have one other thing. I guess now you've spent all these decades working on technology development. And we are in a place today where we've never been, where we're taking the hardware from all that hard work in the past and integrating it, testing it and the test results are coming out really good. We have a lot of team members here that are contributing to that successful effort here today. I guess Gretchen is there one thing piece of advice that you would give the team at this point based upon all your experience over the years and where we're heading? I'm going to address that towards kind of our current environment of uncertainty that we're living in. You guys don't give up hope and don't get discouraged because you saw from my timeline, our budget has done this for that entire time that I've worked here. And you can still see we've managed to crank out hundreds and hundreds of pieces of hardware and integrated tests, some integrated tests before now, and then really we're getting rolling on these integrated tests. So we're going to keep pushing. We're going to keep, even if we have to slow down and take smaller steps forward, we will keep moving forward and keep developing this technology. So just don't give up hope and don't lose heart. Very good. I'd like for you all to give Gretchen a big hand for her effort today. And I'd like to thank each and every one of you for coming. It all was recorded and we'll get that archived. It will be archived with the Engineering Academy eventually. And until Until then, we will keep it on our EC share area. We have a folder under there called Knowledge Capture. You can click on it and you'll see the raw data. Eventually, we want to get it streamed so that when it goes with the EA Academy, you will be able to see the presentation as she's giving the briefing. So I want to thank you guys tremendously. We had a great turnout today and I hope to see you guys at future Knowledge Capture events. Thank you. Thank you."

We have Juniper Girolia who is standing in front of you. Juniper was born in Chicago, Illinois and was raised there, also in San Diego, California and and Quito, Ecuador. After receiving her bachelor's of science in mechanical engineering from Cornell, she worked as a ride and show engineer building Universal Studio and Warner Brothers theme parks in Los Angeles, Japan, and Spain up till about 2001. Afterwards, she worked for NASA Dryden in flight operations before earning her master's of science degree aerospace engineering, at which point she was specializing in bioastronautics and she earned that at the University of Colorado Boulder in 2004. From 2005 to 2008, Juniper worked as a NASA graduate co-op student at JSC here, where she also continued her graduate studies with an emphasis on integrating physiology at UCLA, And she worked as an employee of several commercial spaceflight companies, Blue Origin, XPRIZE, SpaceX, Andrews Space, and Zero Gravity Corporation. In 2008, she returned to JSC with Jacobs Technology, working for our Crew and Thermal Systems Division, and has been a project engineer and a test engineer on the EVA Development and Verification Test Team, where she continues to work today. We have a second speaker today, Robert Durkin. Robert is a product of Harrington, Kansas, and he received his Bachelor's of Science in Aerospace Engineering from Wichita State University. He started his civil servant career with NASA in 1993 over at the WETF. So he was also, he moved over from the WETF and went to the Neutral Buoyancy Facility in 1997, helped to develop the breathing gas system, and was the flight lead for STS-88, which was the first crew to be trained over in the NBL. He then moved on to the engineering directorate, working for EM as the lead for the mock-up development area, and then he went on to work as a subsystem manager for the shuttle landing systems. In 2002, he returned to the NBL as a facility manager, where he continued to take jobs of higher responsibility in the facility. He became chief of the NBL in 2010. So at this time, I'd like to turn it over to Juniper. Thank you, Bill. Provide the presentation. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Robert, for coming. My name is Juniper Jarala, and I'll be presenting on EVA development and verification testing at the And I want to start by saying I owe a lot of what is going to be presented here to the help of my co-authors. This presentation is largely based on another presentation that was given at a recent conference and on an AIAA paper that I co-authored with Robert Durkin, Ralph Marak, Angie Prince, Stephanie Sipola, Scott Parazynski, Art Thomason, and Zane Nye. So thank you to all of them and a couple of them are here too. So to start I wanted to share this topic and write this paper and present this for a few reasons. First of all to increase awareness about the MBL here at the Center and in the community and the industry in general. I also wanted to share how we do MBL testing and development testing and why we do it and and also share ideas on how maybe we could use the NBL for future uses or external uses. And Robert's going to go into that towards the end. So I'm going to go through several topics. I'm going to talk about the background of the NBL, which probably most of you know, but this is being recorded, so who knows who will see it. And actually, that's probably the scariest part. Anyway, I'll talk about the philosophy of the testing that we do, the setup and how the facility is configured for our testing. I'll talk about how we go through and plan each of these tests and what all the roles and responsibilities are, who the players are. Then I'll talk about mock-ups and how we develop hardware for these tests to meet our objectives. I'll go over a typical day of development testing. And I'll go over some of the challenges that we've had and some of the real successes we've had we've had by doing development testing at the MBL. And then some of the... See, this is mostly based on ISS testing, of course, and I'm going to talk a little bit about some other non-ISS-related testing that we've done. And then Robert will talk about external and future uses of the MBL, and then I'll do some acknowledgments. So, as we all know, it's a large indoor pool, 202 feet long by 102 feet wide and 40 feet deep. used for primarily EVA training here at Johnson Space Center. It was built in 1996 to help us build the space station and over that time we've done 126 EVAs and about 840 hours solely to build the space station. Lots of time in space. And it's large enough to accommodate all of the space station components, the whole truss complement, the ISS elements, the international segments, the airlock, all the pallets, HDV4, and up until recently the shuttle payload bay. I love this picture. This is one of the express logistics carrier pallets and one of the truss segments. The rest of the truss segment is over here. Of course we know it's not big enough to accommodate the whole space station in its full configuration, but we get a good chunk of it all in one piece. At its peak we were doing two simultaneous activities in the MBL, up to five suited subjects at a time. We have the 46% oxygen giving our subjects up to 400 minutes or 6.7 hours of underwater time which is similar to what a EVA duration is. And it's also been a very important tool for us in developing hardware for the space station and other NASA programs. Over the time that we've been doing development testing in the MBL, which not me the whole time because this has gone on for years and years, we've looked at over a thousand issues related to hardware development and also spent about 1700 underwater hours to do that. So a lot of development testing and that's aside from all the training that's going on. Now why philosophy? I'm going to say why we use the MBL for development testing and why it's used for training. Of course, there are other alternatives that Johnson Spaniard Center has like parabolic flights where you get that perfect reduced gravity or microgravity time, but it's only about 30 seconds. And also it's very expensive and complex to set up. The nice thing is you don't have the issues of water drag. You don't have the issues of water at all. So thermal and vacuum chambers, which are great for perfectly mimicking the space environment, the thermal conditions, the vacuum conditions. We get that, but we don't get the full-blown setup. And we can't exactly have an astronaut walk around in a thermal chamber in a suit. It's a lot more limited. But we can evaluate hardware exactly in flight configuration and see how it behaves in the environment. We also"

And we can't exactly have an astronaut walk around in a thermal chamber in a suit. It's a lot more limited. But we can evaluate hardware exactly in flight configuration and see how it behaves in the environment. We also have the POGO and the ARGOS, the partial offload gravity system and the, yeah, forget the acronyms. Anyway, these things can raise a person up, offset their weight for a certain amount, and give them the feeling that they would feel if they're walking in 1 6th or 1 3rd gravity, put them on treadmills, have them do tasks like shovel rocks or move heavy objects to give them a sense of what it would be like to perform that limited gravity, but you've got that cumbersome object that's being used to hold them up behind them and also very limiting. We now have Argos that gives you X and Y for movement, but we still don't have Z quite that way we have it in the MBL. And then virtual reality, all these things come together to help astronauts train for EVA. Virtual reality gives them the real visual of what they'll be seeing in space and also with the Charlotte system, we can give them an exact feeling of what it would be like to move a 600-pound piece of hardware, orbital replacement unit. They can feel it and they can see it exactly where their hands would be placed and what kind of body, what kind of inertia they'd have to overcome to move an object, but that's it, that's pretty limited. So we come to the MBL and we get all those things combined with some limitations of course, like the drag, and we can look at things happening in 3D. We can look at moving this large ORU, which probably about, I think, this is the pump module, about 600 pounds in space, correct me if I'm wrong. We can put an astronaut in a foot restraint, another one in another foot restraint, and this person on the truss segment, and this person on the pallet, and we can look at whether these two guys can accomplish removing the ORU from the pallet and handing it over. Basically, this person is doing all the work of removing it from the pallet and has to figure out how to arrange his hands and arms and whether there are handholds on the ORU that allow him to do that and allow him to remove it from the interface on the pallet and if you have the strength and the body positioning to be able to hand it over to another crew member that's on the truss. Things like this we're able to do in the NBL and figure out if it can be done without the arm, for example, whether there be a two-person task. All the things we look at are whether equipment can be translated with, whether it's designed with enough tether points and handrail locations, whether we have the clearances to do to get tools inside to do what we need to do even to get that that ORU off the pallet is there to a clearance to achieve that, whether tasks need to be done with a foot restraint or whether they can be done free float some some pistol grip tool PGT torques are a little more than one could handle in free float or put the body restraint tether so they have to be done with the foot restraint we look at whether tasks can be accomplished with one crew member or two or need whether a task needs to be two-handed task or a single-handed task recently we've looked that tools to repair sharp edges on the space station. And one requirement that designers were hoping to achieve was that this be a one-handed task, so that crews can be holding on to a handrail on the space station and be scraping with the tool with the other. Now, if this tool had not been designed such that you could do anything with it with only one hand, then of course it would have to be redesigned, would be named a two-handed task. So we evaluate things like that also. We evaluate where crew members will have to position their bodies for certain tasks. We look at reach, whether they have reach to in the suit, as we all know is very limiting, cumbersome, heavy, and whether there'll be arm assistance needed for a task. And as I mentioned there are, there of all we know, 126 EVAs so far to build, in total to build a space station and they're most the most complex that have been performed in human spaceflight history all with the help of the MBO we've also used it for hardware certification say for example an analysis determines that a task is not achievable in the suit because there are standards that need to be met of clearance of work envelope these are put into a large CAD system and evaluated with the hardware, and it's deemed that such a task is not possible because work envelope requirements are not met or tool clearance or glove clearance requirements are not met. But in reality, we know that humans are special and creative and can probably do a little bit better than a computer calculates that they can. So we'll come to the NBL and we'll show that a requirement or task can be met that analysis showed that it couldn't. So that's been very useful as well. We'll accept hardware that's by evaluated in the MBL. We'll accept certain aspects of it. We'll sometimes close flight hardware requirements. And why? Like I said, analysis has to come up, has to use a lot of assumptions. The more assumptions you have, the more inaccurate your analysis is. So we come with real people into the MBL and we look at actual hardware and evaluate it. So there are several phases that in development testing can be done. We've done it in pre-PDR or the requirements phase when hardware designers are just writing the requirements for the hardware. They're just coming up with the broad concepts. We'll use really low or medium fidelity mockups and we'll just look at whether requirements are even adequate. A recent example was there was an idea to perhaps make the pump module modular so that if it broke, not the whole pump module would have to be removed from the truss and replaced. Maybe we could develop something that had smaller pieces and if one smaller piece was broken, then that would be removed and wouldn't have to do the whole thing so we looked at whether a crew member could get inside the truss and actually have the clearance to remove something that might be built into the pump module like a smaller box and whether that was even possible so that to tell us well at least we meet the requirement of being able to get inside the truss the rest about designing the modular pump module is the next step another phase. We also do between PDR and CDR testing, between preliminary design review and critical design review,"

We'll use really low or medium fidelity mockups and we'll just look at whether requirements are even adequate. A recent example was there was an idea to perhaps make the pump module modular so that if it broke, not the whole pump module would have to be removed from the truss and replaced. Maybe we could develop something that had smaller pieces and if one smaller piece was broken, then that would be removed and wouldn't have to do the whole thing so we looked at whether a crew member could get inside the truss and actually have the clearance to remove something that might be built into the pump module like a smaller box and whether that was even possible so that to tell us well at least we meet the requirement of being able to get inside the truss the rest about designing the modular pump module is the next step another phase. We also do between PDR and CDR testing, between preliminary design review and critical design review, and that's actually where most MBL testing occurs. We look at operability of the hardware in the integrated space station environment or future vehicle environment. We'll use more fidelity mock-ups, medium to high fidelity mock-ups, and we'll do more more precise testing. We'll have objectives that are more exacting. We'll have more specific tasks that we need to show that we can accomplish with the hardware. And after CDR is another phase that development testing can occur. This will look at the operational timelines. We'll use really high fidelity mockups and we'll look at integrating a single task that maybe we looked at during the PDR to CDR phase into a full length EVA. And sometimes when that happens, if we've shown that a piece of hardware or design is adequate during PDR and CDR, it turns out to be not ideal once integrated into a full-length EVA. And that portion becomes more of the trainers and flight controllers job as opposed to engineering and development testing. But that's what we'll sometimes find out is that a minor redesign needs to occur once The full EVA is taken into account, other tasks, the robotic arm, people, et cetera. This, I just wanted to say this is a picture of, you all know? Scott? Doing the, actually that's a picture of Scott too. He gave me all the pictures he had. Credit Scott for the pictures. Another important aspect of the test philosophy is crew selection. So all crew members are EVA qualified, of course, and they can all make valuable suggestions. But there are certain things we have to make sure we take into account when we're saying this hardware is operable, for example. One is anthropometrics. We want to make sure we're getting a good broad range represented in our tests of the tallest crew member with the longest arms that can reach you name it everywhere and fix solar panels to the shorter crew members with shorter arms, maybe different girths, et cetera. When we are doing operability testing, we're matching the work envelope to the worksite, to the human, and some things will be critical. When we looked at ELCs and there were the interfaces to release the ELC from the truss, there were, strangely enough, the shorter crew members were more able to get to these bolts than the taller crew members. The taller crew members were saying I can't get it, you know, this is not doable. The shorter crew members were having an easier time of it, but there were other tasks in that same development series that were easier for the taller crew members. So it's important to look at everyone's abilities. We look at the heights, we looked at range of arm lengths, we look at various skirts. The other thing is this the skill and experience mix of a crew. We've seen that not all crew perform at the same level and that's okay. More skill and experience means you might get more accurate and thorough feedback, but then again, say for future when we have contingency maintenance to do on the ISS, something like a pump module just suddenly breaks and you've got who you got on board to fix it, we want to know that tasks, that objectives that hardware is operable by the decent broad range of astronauts that could be on the ISS at any one time when something happens. So this goes into our testing very important way and to achieve a consensus on a piece of hardware we need six astronauts. So that's how these are put together. And now the test setup for the facility. As a lot of people here know there are two high bays on either side of the mbl of the pool that's for staging and maintenance of mock-ups there are two there are 10 ton overhead bridge cranes that allow us to move i shouldn't say us i should say mbl but allow the mbl to move mock-ups in and out of the water there's underwater digital audio video so we can see everything that's going on hear everything that's going on with breathing gas and cooling through the life support umbilicals to the space suits and operational staff includes two safety divers one utility diver and one camera diver per subject per test then we have our suit engineers our suit technicians our subsystem operators people that operate the crane the people that dry off the floor so we don't slip etc now every test event or every test series for development testing is consists of a four hour scuba run that's about a week before all the suited runs happen this is where people like me get in the water with the astronauts and talk too much on the microphones explain to them how to do what the hardware looks like what the test setup is where are the interfaces are that they need to worry about during the testing and a general overview of everything that they're going to see once they're in a suit it's it's a familiarization run and also to get them the test out some things they might want to be more familiar with before getting the suit. Sometimes we'll verify foot restraint settings so we don't waste time doing it in the suited runs. We'll do measurements on hardware, especially if we're doing a verification on hardware. We'll check clearances between mockups to make sure that the test configuration is flight-like and what we need to look at so that when we're testing, we're actually confident that we're representing what it would be like in space and we can say, yay, this is good. And then we have a six-hour engineering run, which is a suited run, typically with suited subjects, engineers I mean, and we run through our procedures, every little detail and make sure we have everything all ready to go before we take astronauts' time in the suit. Then we have three six-hour suited runs with astronauts and two crew per day, and we run them through those, all of those procedures. So I've added this back in. I thought it might be useful for those who are looking to do some MBL development testing coming up. There's the mock-up hardware and development flow, how we get things, how we get hardware ready for the MBL testing. It starts with a test conductor, which could be someone like me, or it could be someone from the training or flight control group, like Scott here, this Scott, will say these are the tools and the objectives and the equipment interfaces that we want to look at in this test. And then from that list, determine what the hardware requirements are, and then work with the flight lead at the MBL to discuss these requirements and check with the flight lead on"

There's the mock-up hardware and development flow, how we get things, how we get hardware ready for the MBL testing. It starts with a test conductor, which could be someone like me, or it could be someone from the training or flight control group, like Scott here, this Scott, will say these are the tools and the objectives and the equipment interfaces that we want to look at in this test. And then from that list, determine what the hardware requirements are, and then work with the flight lead at the MBL to discuss these requirements and check with the flight lead on whether the hardware that we need is available in the MBL. The Flight Ely will check in the inventory and let us know if it is there or not. This can be anything from a tool, a small itty-bitty ORU. It can be a detail about a piece of hardware. It can be a detail about how high fidelity it is, whether it is built up with the interfaces that we want to check with all the little bolts and springs and panels and everything. or they can come back to us and say we have this hardware, but only a volumetric version of it. It just tells you how big it is and maybe gives you the external handrails that would be on it. But it doesn't give you all the little widgets that would have to be operated on. So if that's something we want in our test, we'll come back and say then that needs to be built. Or, for example, does one of the external sources might have it, Boeing, Jacobs, Lockheed. If that's the case, test conductor will get it from Boeing and Lockheed with a long paperwork process and then bring it back to the MBL. If not, then the choice is to fabricate a new mock-up or fabricate modifications to a mock-up through which a change request is submitted either by DX or by the crew office, engineers in the CB or engineers in the EVA training office. And then the NBL develops the hardware and they use this document, the NBL mock-up and training hardware requirements, which detail how hardware needs to be built for specific use in the NBL. For example, whether it will be built out of, whether it will be flight-like, just functional, operable or just static, as I was mentioning before, whether it's going to be more class three, class one, class two, class one category, how high fidelity it's going to be basically. We'll also look at whether we have to use stainless steel for the hi-fi interfaces. Stainless steel has been used for nodes, for example, for the structure. Fiber reinforced plastic has been used for the truss structures. Kydex is used for skins of large mockups. and ultra high molecular weight, UHMW, polyethylene for smaller mockups, and in for some tools like the PGT, and some of these smaller boxes. This here is the node two heat exchangers. And as I was saying, sometimes we might just want to know whether a crew member can translate by a node two end cone. Or we want to know whether a crew member can remove a panel from the end cone and actually remove a heat exchanger and replace it. This has to be built up so that this test can be achieved. And not every heat exchanger in the pool might be represented to such detail. There are other features that the MBL uses to make hardware behave appropriately, such as large lightning holes like these to reduce drag in the water and then embedding foam you don't see it but there's always pieces of foam in here to help it float more and also to weigh it out we want to make we want we want hardware to behave as neutrally buoyant as possible in as we can in all directions and so for that foam is added to little corners and things to help achieve that. There's also a lot of trade-off that's done when all the negotiations that happen when change request is put in. We'll say at first ask for everything, the full shebang, but there will be time limitations. MBL tests, MBL development tests are often put together on shorter timelines than say a training plan for a mission. So we'll have instead of a year we'll have maybe couple months to get some piece of hardware built. So while we would like to have all the little details that would be on this piece of hardware for our test, sometimes that's just not humanly possible, so MBL comes back to us and says can we give you this instead? Can we fake it with this? And the test conductor and the whole planning team decides what we can live with and what we can still what we can use to still meet our objectives everyone pretty much has a say in these kinds of things from the principal investigator operations crew office engineering you name it so as I was starting to say there are all these people that come into play to help put together a test and I'm also mentioning that it takes about two to four months for the planning to occur for a development test typically. Starts with a principal investigator who's also the test requester and this can be a person from anywhere, XA, the crew office, DX, a hardware provider like Boeing or Lockheed, someone from another Center, someone that has money, the Canadians, you name it. And there's the EVA office representative that would be someone like Stephanie Zippola here who determines what the content of the test will be and prioritizes the objectives for it of course with the whole team also contributing to that then will be a test engineer and EVA development and verification test team lead such as I or soon Brian Burry he's training for a test coming up doing the bulk of the test planning and documentation and coordination and then ultimately being the test conductor this is someone from EC 7 or Jacobs mission operations is also in in the team providing expertise on operations mock-up requirements writing those CCRs for us. Crew Office Representative sometimes also submits CRs, selects the crew for the test, writes the crew consensus report at the end after all the six astronauts have said yay or nay on every little task, and provides that crew perspective that unique to the crew a little more than anyone else can provide. They know more intricately what really a crew is going to be willing and able to do in space or might consider to be worthwhile or consider to be testable etc. The flight lead from the MBL is also very important to this, coordinates the pool configuration, brings all the mock-ups to us by help of their people at the MBL and this is someone from DX12 Raytheon and project lead from the MBL who is responsible for getting the hardware, the mock-up certified for testing, running it through all the all the paperwork, the design reviews, the safety reviews, etc. also can design it and build it. I wanted to show here the pictures from scuba runs, scuba runs, engineering run, actually that's my SuperQOL, never mind. Okay, so more detail about the development of verification planning flow. This hopefully will be helpful to some people here. As I mentioned, the team that goes into"

I wanted to show here the pictures from scuba runs, scuba runs, engineering run, actually that's my SuperQOL, never mind. Okay, so more detail about the development of verification planning flow. This hopefully will be helpful to some people here. As I mentioned, the team that goes into it and starts with the customer, usually the EVA office, identifying a test request and working with a principal investigator to assign the test, to request the test, then goes to the test conductor to start planning it and it's assigned to someone to start planning it and also we meet with the MBO long-range planning meeting to assign a time, a block of time within the whole EVA calendar to do these tests and it's we usually because we want to be able to have an uninterrupted block of time. As I mentioned, we have a scuba run and then four suited runs, basically, and our setups are usually unique and special for the pool. And we don't want to interfere with training time in the pool, which is higher priority. So we're often going in and asking for four straight days or more of uninterrupted pool time and monopolization of the pool and hardware in the pool. So it's key that we start planning early on as possible with long-range planning people to say this is the, we need this amount of time to do this and we need these mock-ups in this special configuration to do it. They need to know ahead of time and they need to be able to tell us, well, we have training coming up and, or we have maintenance week and, you know, that can't be interrupted, etc. So then once all that's settled, test conductor starts weekly, starts a kickoff with the MBL, with the crew office, operations, the PI, everyone involved and starts saying what are our objectives, what's the background of this test, what are we really trying to achieve, what's the schedule, who our who our players are and who needs to be included and we do these meetings weekly pretty much through the whole two to four months to coordinate and develop these objectives and there'll be things that change sometimes week to week as we get more as we might get more information about the hardware available to us for example or as the hardware becomes more and more ready and we'll get we'll get a status on that of course each week we'll get pool configuration laid out more in detail as the time goes on and as that happens, which takes the two to four months before test, as that happens then the test conductor starts writing a test plan, writing the hazard analysis or making sure it's written and ready, writing the test procedures with inputs from people on the team, operations, even a crew office. They'll be, sometimes we'll start with detailed test procedures or mocked procedures from, say, the concept of operations or operations group, but we really just want a minor piece of that test, so we'll remove all the excess. Maybe we don't need to know torques or maybe we don't need to know exactly where the tool is being stowed because in testing, in development testing, we're more concerned about the specific task, a diver will hold the tool for us, for example. So we'll simplify a lot of times. We will sometimes, we'll have to look at whether it's going to be a two member or two crew member task or one crew member task. A lot of times we'll lay out the order of the test based on what the priorities of the tests are, whether hardware is going to be needed by another group going through testing or training on a certain day or time. We'll look at if say two crew members need to work on this task but the next task is only needing one crew member, maybe we can save time by doubling up on tasks. Quite often we'll have more objectives than we have in the six hours, than we can accomplish in the six hours. So we'll double up on things. And we'll make sure that a crew member that doesn't accomplish a task or doesn't work a task has enough view to see what is done by the other crew member to be able to comment on it later on. But I'm getting ahead of myself. So the flight lead's job is also huge and key, communicating the objectives to and the pool setup requirements to the MBL team, the dive operations team, and sets up the preliminary configuration meeting, which is something that happens one to two months before the test where we sit with the operations team at the NBL and say these are the tasks we're going to do, this is the hardware we need, this is any reconfiguration we might need from your team during the test that you need to be aware of so that you plan accordingly, assign the people that know what, that know maybe or more familiar with the hardware and could work it better, you know this is what you need to account for in terms of pool setup and maybe identify any safety issues or potential life hazards that we'll have to take into account during the test because as I mentioned a lot of our configurations are special and unique and sometimes we'll kind of walk that fine line with using hardware in perhaps slightly unusual ways but to represent something that we're trying to accomplish and for that NBL will go through the process to assure that that special crest is safe and can be achieved safely and and if necessary documented as a live hazard so that divers and subjects are aware of it during the test. Then the crew office of course arranges the crew support for the test and then like I mentioned flight lead and the test conductor determine if new hardware is needed. And then as we get closer, a few weeks before the test, test conductor starts putting together mountains of paperwork. The briefing package for the crew, the TRR package for the hardware or the operations if necessary, the pre-dive forms submitting in the calendar, what exactly the pool configuration needs to be down to every detail and in the order of objectives, the camera requirements, the arm requirements, if any, the tool requests they're submitted to at this time so that USA can start pulling tools out. This is put together based on the objectives and the procedures that the team has all worked on together about two to four months prior. And then of course the test conductor conducts the briefings and the scuba run and the suited runs at times with contribution from the team members. Hardware experts will come in and be able to explain something way better than I can. So that sometimes occurs. Crew office will sometimes have specific tasks they want to run. Operations may, it just depends. The flight lead course rights configuration checklists for the divers. Step-by-step checklist too based on the free dive forms and get the dive team in, sets it all up and all that in the few days before testing. So then the day of, what do we do in the morning? We get"

Step-by-step checklist too based on the free dive forms and get the dive team in, sets it all up and all that in the few days before testing. So then the day of, what do we do in the morning? We get there very early, the crack of dawn with the astronauts and run them through their objectives really quickly again and give them a last-minute familiarization of the hardware and the pool setup and their tools and we help them if they have questions about what tools they need, where they need to put tools, if they need them on their mini workstations or not, if they could just throw them in the basket and the divers will get them or not, et cetera. Then of course the suit donning and doffing process. We just sit back and watch the test director and the MBL team do that and then conduct the test. After the test director says go, then we have six hours to run it or we have until 3 p.m., whichever comes first. objectives or the objectives are complete before then then we stop to then the suits are doffed and we have post dive debriefing with with the subjects which takes particularly on our sometimes hardware providers will be there with the hardware or with flight versions of the hardware to discuss comments sometimes hardware providers will get their comments and go straight into redesigning their hardware or they'll wait for the test reports to come later and do their redesigns or whatever. Then of course working the console, that's a real-time ballgame. There are, of course we have desired objectives we have to ensure that we meet, but a lot of times we'll have unforeseen circumstances. Sometimes we'll get results that we didn't anticipate and we'll have to reprioritize our testing or pool use conflicts will come up other suddenly someone some other tests going on needs something or they'll be the delayed start due to a due to a suit issue or a mock-up issue things just come up meanwhile we're always trying to do as much as we can't get as much of those objectives completed in the six hours however we can and safely and with and and of course maximize crew time not have too much sitting there idle time nobody wants that unless they're tired and we'll give pre-emptive direction to divers we'll say okay in five minutes I know I need this piece of hardware set up so we start telling divers ahead of time while we're giving direction to the crew to set up this hardware get it ready or swim it over to wherever. And then of course if there are if we're using the arm there are other added protocols for that communicating with the arm operator in addition to that. And then afterwards I mean during the test course this is the type of data we collect it's whether a task can be accomplished, how many how many crew members worked on it, how many hands, what tools were used, what the foot restraint settings were, what the body positions exactly were, any changes to the procedures, and any crew comments that they can provide actually during the test while they're in the suit, which amazingly enough they're sometimes very good. And then we add that on to everything that they give us in the debrief. And then audio and video is recorded of course. We'll always have a diver take still photos. For example, if If we wanted to know that this boat can be accessed with a PGT or if it not with a smaller tool, we'll make sure we get a picture of the crew member in the suit doing that so that it's documented later, it's put in a test report, it's proven, it closes a requirement, whatever. And the two methods for recording this is the EDVT report, which the test conductor writes, and the crew consensus report, which the crew office writes. It would be Zane Nye or Oscar Kaler, for example. The test reports include the quick look. Everyone probably knows what a quick look is. It comes out three days after and just covers what we, basically what we accomplished, if there are any safety issues, and maybe some basic photos. We cover the test report, comes out several weeks later, all the details, objectives, results, pictures of every task. the procedures as they turned out, and the crew consensus report. And then the crew consensus report comes out rating all the objectives one by one with their acceptability and the hardware for acceptability. And that is what is used later for actual requirements verification. This table here is the EVA hardware and task ratings that the crew office uses for their consensus reports. And a lot of the stuff is in the paper that I mentioned too. People want to look at it more later. So I won't go through it, but it just says a task is acceptable or unacceptable with some details or we don't have an idea. It's inconclusive. We have to retest, for example. One of the points that we wanted to make, and this is talked about extensively in the paper, is the usefulness of NVL development testing and maybe some ways that it could have been used differently. And one of the examples is we had a, I shouldn't say we, but people had a great, this was before my time, so there was great success with the Hubble servicing. There were tasks that people didn't think were originally possible through EVA. There were, the Hubble was not designed, a lot of it was not designed to be serviced And yet with all this vetting in the MBL, with developing specialized new tools and evaluating them in the MBL, great success was achieved with servicing the Hubble, fixing it. That's one great example. An example of maybe where it could have been used more, but this is all based on many factors, is in the development of the SEDA carts. Great testing went on, part test testing of the SEDA carts. There was, however, not an opportunity for many reasons. Certain operational paradigms were not available yet. Some information was not available yet. So we couldn't look at an evaluation of the integrated task, the whole door-to-door, see-the-cart setup and use and then moving and then reset up. So had this been done, maybe, there might have been some inefficiencies that would have identified and maybe in the cancer the project would have been cancelled and save money because if you ask an astronaut now that they don't really use them out there they find other ways that are easier and save time and save money and less overhead and they really more in the way they they have to get moved out of the way to do other things more than anything and so that's some of the challenges that there have been now I really wanted to share this but there's There's constellation related testing that went on in the NBL for looking at the Orion"

They looked at placing handrails on Orion on orbit as while translating to Altair or from Altair. Fun stuff. Too bad we don't have that program anymore. Near-earth asteroid exploration has been looked at. That shuttle tile repair wall that was built was repurposed for a very very interesting task. Here was little rocks were put on the wall with Velcro and in order to simulate, say, a station keeping vehicle with a robotic arm on it, some vehicle that would be floating along the asteroid and would have a person on the end of the arm trying to collect geologic samples or asteroidologic samples. The idea is to say the asteroid would be spinning at some who knows rate. So to represent that, we had the crew member, we had the arm basically moving along at a very slow speed. We tried several speeds, and we had crew members pulling rocks off of the wall or grabbing them with little off-the-shelf kind of tools for sampling that we brought in, and also looked at an existing tool, the ISS EVA wipe and an empty gloved hand just to see how is this possible? How fast can we go? Things like that. Now I'll turn it over to Robert for future uses and external customers. Hello everyone. I just wanted to give you a quick background on what we're doing, commercialization at the MBL. Like Juniper had mentioned, the MBL was built to assemble the International Space Station. That's obviously behind us. We're now in a maintenance mode. And with the end of the shuttle program, the amount of EVAs we're doing has drastically gone down. During what we called the wave of EVAs, we were doing 300 events a year, and next year we're projected to about 150. We obviously knew that was coming, so we looked at what ways can we use the facility to offset our costs, to actually get money coming in, cost savings to the government, to keep the facility open. It's a very expensive facility to operate, and so we looked at ways of offsetting our costs. So when we were looking at that, we knew it wasn't, you know, our typical mode of operation is it's a very risky environment when you do a spacewalk. So we have a lot of controls in place that you make sure you do it right. However, if you bring in a commercial entity, they most likely don't need to go to that level. So what we did is looked at all the potential customers coming in and then reevaluated how we did kind of our rules and regulations. We did a URR, a use readiness review. We brought a board together that was actually signed off by Coats that said we will actually go and use commercial, federal, and state rules and regulations when we're dealing with these other commercial entities. So that will actually make us competitive in that kind of a market. And I guess competitive is not the right word. Actually be able to work in that market because since we're the government, we don't compete. We go into a market that currently doesn't have that niche being taken care of. And that's the NBL because of its size is very unique. So that's where we stepped in. So we did a URR. It was approved at the center level. That allowed us to be able to do a lot more of the commercial activities that we're doing today. Some of the areas that we're starting to look into, obviously government to government is good. We've done some water survival training for people like at Ellington or the Coast Guard and stuff like that that has been very successful. We've gone to academia. We've done some testing for them. They did a neutral body position to see the changes of a person when they're in the body due to the neutral environment that you're in. That was successful. And then also we were looking at the private industry, like the petrochemical industry, And there's a lot of similarities in our facility that they can use. Plus, we're very close to the Gulf Coast where a lot of those companies operate. So that has been very successful so far. So we really kind of changed how we do operations. It's starting to be successful. We haven't focused on doing this until about two years ago. So we're still kind of in our infancy of doing this. So here lately we've been successful and I hope it continues to gain momentum to be able to offset our costs to keep the facility up for a long time. It's a unique U.S. asset that we want to be able to have available, hopefully for the next U.S. program that comes in, but here for the short term for the academia, for the other commercial entities and stuff like that. So I think that hits everything we had for commercial. I know we're running really short on time, so I'll hang around for an extra 15, 20 minutes. So I know the commercialization is very new to the center and the agency. So if anybody has any specific questions that we don't get in the hour, I'll hang around. You know, just saying how unique and special the NBL is and how valuable it's been to the space program and, you know, specifically the shuttle Hubble programs. You know, there's been comments from external customers that, I don't know if I want to say it or if you want to say it, but saying that, you know, there's no other place that they can do, that has all the capabilities for them to be able to do system integration testing and timeline development for new technologies like quite in the way that the MBL has with just all those, all those, all those capabilities available. You know, Hubble, the cost of testing in the MBL was a fraction of the cost of what would have been on orbit EVA development. There's millions of dollars that have been saved by the EVA testing and training. And we mentioned again the CETA carts. You know, we could have tested some more there. That would have helped. There's pre-Columbia testing that went, I mean, post-Columbia testing that went on to save the shuttle basically. You know, just prove that we"

And there's a lot of life cycle cost savings that results by doing testing. You know, you make sure your hardware is operational and meets requirements before you get too far into your design or your development. And, you know, we think that, we hope that future spacecraft designers and space hardware designers will see that and maybe come and use the MBL for things like that. And I just wanted to thank a few people."

But I'm just privileged to be able to also have the funding from NESC as well to help support Vlodinka to do the administration of these events. So we'll have not only this one, but we'll have at least five more events this year just focusing on spacesuits. And we're very privileged to have Jim here. And so what I'd like to do is introduce you to this young man. He has spread the history of spacesuits all the way from Mercury to Space Station. He's one of a kind. I've gotten to know him over the last several years since he's done other knowledge capture events for us. And to give you a little bit of background, he actually has a degree in geology from University of Dayton, Ohio. But his real work started when he started with a job at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base close by the university where he was attending. He started doing research there and testing with some of the high altitude space suits and high altitude suits used for the aircraft for the Air Force and Navy. And so that, after his graduation, that experience was so unique that it really led to his employment with NASA. And the rest is history. He went ahead and he's done pretty much every job you could possibly do working on space suits. I said from Mercury to station but he held he was like the chief engineer for EVA projects and then eventually he was the branch chief over all the spacesuit development and operations all the way up until he retired so when he retired he went to work for ILC for a while and worked there and helped them and then And today he's still consulting, so much so that he's doing this wonderful knowledge capture events for us. And hopefully someday he'll be publishing a book as well from all the data that he's collected. And hopefully this knowledge capture opportunity will add to the material that goes in that book, we hope. So without further ado, I would like to introduce to you today Jim McBaron. Jim, you're welcome. Thank you for the nice introduction, Cinda. Actually my experience started way back in support of the U2 program at Wright-Patterson and Project Black Dragon at that time and several other programs. But anyway, today this is sort of the second part of the Apollo 7 to 14 development activity. Today I want to go through some of the technical and readiness reviews that we conducted as well as some certification data and then some mission experience for all of the 7 to 14 missions that are strictly suit related. If you have any questions about any of the missions there is a load of data on the internet for each of the missions. But you won't find the data I'm going to present on the Internet yet. And finally, I'm going to finish with a listing of the lessons learned that you might find interesting. And before that, some records use data that we kept from the log books from the actual use of the flight suits for each of those missions. In terms of technical reviews, of course, the first one and the subsequent ones were required by the Apollo program as part of the Apollo Configuration Management Document, NPC 500-1. And each of these reviews were part of that, and this is the way the SUTE program implemented those particular reviews. In the preliminary design review, which was the first formal review, NASA reviewed with the contractor comments to the CEI or contract end item specifications for each of the suit parts with the contractor. And the review contained or concluded people from NASA Reliability, NASA Quality Assurance, And of course the technical people from crew systems division. The configuration of the suit at this point in time was pretty much established in terms of being a prototype based upon the competition for the three suits, with the three suits Apollo Block 2 which I previously presented here as a knowledge capture session. And so it was primarily a review of the configuration to authorize the contractor to start design verification testing to verify any changes that were made to that earlier configuration and to subject it to the certification level lifecycle requirements that existed at that point in time. This review was chaired by the ILC program manager and myself as a technical manager on the contract or contract check monitor, project officer. I had a whole bunch of different NASA titles, all of which were the same in terms of what I did. And we reviewed each of the review item disposition items that were submitted by either the NASA people. We had some NASA contractor consultants come up and participated like Bell Incorporated and all those RIDs were dispositioned by the program manager and myself for action and a closure due date. Each of these RIDs were included in a set of meeting minutes that were published for all the people who attended the review and the product of the review ended up being not only the meeting minutes but also the proposed configuration of the prototype CEIs and by CEI I mean the PGA, the gloves, the helmet, the EVA, LCBG and all the parts of the spacesuit assembly. The next review that was held, next formal review, was the critical design review. At this point in time, NASA submitted the, the ILC submitted the end item configuration for NASA review and approval. And we reviewed the results of design verification testing that was conducted at this time and any changes or problems that resulted from that. The reliability people looked at the failure modes and effects analysis and the critical items list that had been submitted. Again, the RID form was used to document findings and was dispositioned by the program manager and myself and distributed to the attendees. And the product of the review was authorization for the contractor to proceed with production of the first controlled CEIs for certification testing. Okay, Jim? Yes. That DVT was full man cycling, right? The DVT was full man cycling. Full pressure garment. Full pressure garment at the time. It did include some unmanned tests also, but primarily, an interesting point of that, ILC originally proposed to test the life endurance of the convolutes with a mechanical test fixture. and they subjected four different sets of convolutes on this mechanical test fixture, and they went some 25,000 pressurized cycles. We put the man in a suit, and DVT, he went about 5,000. So we determined that unmanned testing for joint cycling was not appropriate any further, and we only relied on manned testing, and I'll get into why that is true in a later chart. In addition to the configuration review of the as designed, now we're in the FASI point, okay, we reviewed the specs to make sure they were all current and approved with any changes incorporated. We reviewed the as designed versus the as built configuration of the first production units. As I mentioned last week, after the 201 accident, we were required to submit material usage agreements for any flammable material that could not be deleted from the suit assembly for suitability reasons. They were reviewed to make sure they had all been approved by the Apollo program. All the DVT test programs were identified and resolved with any changes identified that were incorporated. That initial acceptance test of each end item was satisfactorily completed. And again, RIDs and meeting minutes were prepared and submitted for all the attendees. Controlled production of the initial and later"

That initial acceptance test of each end item was satisfactorily completed. And again, RIDs and meeting minutes were prepared and submitted for all the attendees. Controlled production of the initial and later CEIs. The first three production sets of hardware, PGAs, LCBGs, and helmets and gloves, were subjected to endurance life cycle testing at the ILC plant. One of the benefits of this is that any problems that occurred, the ILC personnel would have immediate first-hand knowledge of the problem, could analyze it, and submit their findings to us. sort of like a check and balance on what they did and what they recommended. Just for your interest at the time there were some people that wanted to do that testing at JSC and it was felt that by doing it at the ILC plant it gave us more of a check and balance on the results of the hardware. The second and third sets of suit hardware were allocated for both NASA JSC and HAM standard certification testing mostly at the EMU level. Subsequent production end items were allocated for crew training and for flight. The crew training hardware was built to the same standards and controls as the flight hardware and that was an issue at that time also as why do we spend the extra money for quality assurance inspection and oversight like we did for flight suits. And it was a cost analysis determined to have one production line that built all the hardware the same way to the same procedures with quality was less expensive and less of a of a problem for our personnel that would be required than just having them all built the same way, controlled. Of course to test the hardware you need good ground support equipment and the test stands that were used were required to be delivered by HAMP standard under the HAMP standard EMU PLIS contract that was provided and used at all test sites at a HAMP standard at ILC at JSC and KSC. This allowed standardized preparation and use of suit test procedures and allowed for minimized test personnel training because when we sent a tech to the CAPE from JSC to help out down there, he was familiar to how the test stand operated and the procedures, and it was not a problem. And we did transfer people back and forth between JSC and KSC to support the activities. In terms of the acceptance test, every CEI or every end item was required to be acceptance tested to a set of NASA approved procedures that was later the product of a signature on a DD 250 for government acceptance. Included in this testing were the items shown, the leakage, proof pressure, and so on, an astronaut fit check. The policy was custom made to each individual flight astronaut's measurements and glove molds for his hands. And one of the ways that we assured that the customization was correct is that we had the each astronaut go up to the ILC plant, conduct a fit check of his units before they were subjected to formal pre-delivery acceptance testing. And he actually signed a buy-off sheet that he was satisfied with the fit that was used as part of the government acceptance. Now, if he disagreed with the fit, the issues were identified and ILC was required to make the fixes necessary before the suit was delivered. Sometimes this required a second, maybe even a third fit check back at the plant. I must say the astronauts weren't too happy to go back to the plant, but I'm sure when they started flying and using their suits, they found that having a good fitting suit was essential to do the tasks that were required. Pre-installation acceptance testing was conducted on the suit or CEI or the assembly prior to every ground test or every flight. These were conducted that included all the items shown there and were conducted prior to certification testing, crew training, and proof flight checkout. In terms of the tests that were conducted, was the manned life endurance testing conducted at ILC. We actually put together a team of NASA and ILC personnel, suit personnel, to review video of the tasks that were expected to be performed during the mission. In the purpose of the review, each person was provided a counter clicker and he was assigned to, and at that time we only had men working as techs, he was assigned a joint to count the cycles on during a crewman actually performing the test or during watching the video. Sometimes we did actual tests. The product of that was a set of requirements for life cycle testing that was used. And we came up with an equation that the requirement was all the cycles that could be conducted on a suit pre-flight plus two times a mission set of cycles plus a set of contingency cycles that would be resulting from a problem during the mission. and band testing was conducted at both unpressurized or vent pressure and the operating pressure 3.75 with air since we weren't allowed to use oxygen at this point in time and this testing as I mentioned provided a quick problem resolution and incorporation of design changes while this was going on EMU performance testing was being prepared for testing in the Building 7 8-foot chamber back then is when we did the EMU test with the PLIS and OPS. In the 20-foot chamber that had attached to it an auxiliary glove and boot thermal vac chamber where we actually did the environmental testing to prove the adequacy of the gloves and the boots for exposure to the worst case thermal conditions, hot and cold, that would be exceeded during the mission. And in the, eventually in Chamber B, vacuum and Chamber A for thermal vacuum testing. Now these tests were not conducted until we had an adequate quantity of cycles testing conducted that was required by the readiness review group that's authorized proceeding with manned testing. Additional pre-flight tests that were supported was the vacuum training conducted at an eight-foot chamber at Crew Systems. Every crew member checked out his EMU in the eight-foot chamber to make sure it was adequate and CO2 was good and metabolic rate calibrations were conducted. And at the KSC in the command module in the LM, which were exposed to vacuum with the crew for a check out of the LM and command module systems, in a ground level C squared, F squared it was called, crew compartment fit and function, where the interfaces between the crew member, the suit, and the inside of the modules were conducted. This is a listing of the cycle requirements that were conducted at ILC as part of the certification for Apollo 7, which was the C mission, Apollo missions. And you can see the number of cycles that were required for the shoulder and elbow. We rechecked the, these were done for Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 10 since they had no or minimum amount of EVA required. Apollo 9 had a small amount of EVA, but these were the cycles used for the C missions. For the G missions, which was the"

Apollo 9 had a small amount of EVA, but these were the cycles used for the C missions. For the G missions, which was the lunar surface missions starting with Apollo 11, We redid the cycle team count of required cycles, and this is what was established to be the cycle requirements total for the G missions and for Apollo 12 and 14 for the H missions where we redid the numbers based upon a better definition of the tasks that we'd be expected to see during the mission. Again, the cycle life was equal to the pre-flight testing, mission total, and contingency. This lists some of the certification tests that were performed at ILC Dover, starting with the florel boot soles, and we had to change to a non-flammable boot sole to meet the use requirements. The mission C Earth Orbital EVA as I talked about when it was conducted. The C prime which was part with an Earth Orbital EVA conducted on Apollo 9. The TMG ReQual for mission D and the Lunar Surface Qual for the lunar missions. can see we finished cycle testing just before the lunar landing which occurred in July the following month. The final technical reviews that were conducted was called the design certification review. Some of you may not be familiar with that term but this was It was a program level review that was required to be conducted on all first flight item hardware and it was conducted by the contractor with NASA Technical Management and findings presented to the program office. done on every new first-time set of hardware that flew in Apollo. The content of that review was that we completed all the cert test requirements, all the cert failures and corrective actions were reviewed and verified to have been implemented, the status of training and flight, CEI's failure closures with the The closure plan and date were reviewed so that not only included was the flight hardware but any problems we had with the training hardware and any open work related to completion of the flight hardware with its completion date and catch all that they put at the end of the requirement was any and all issues that might affect flight readiness. Flight readiness reviews were conducted prior to each and every mission. Conducted to verify the flight hardware was ready to support the mission. Any configuration changes from the prior mission were identified. Certification, open items, and closure status were reviewed. And open failure reports and closure status were reviewed not only by NASA contractors but with the NASA program office personnel. The final review was sort of an unofficial review that ILC management and myself initiated that looked at some additional items for the hardware for each mission. And we started that with Apollo 11 and all subsequent lunar surface missions. We had the plant technical and reliability review all discrepancy reports dispositioned from JSC and KSC to verify that they were adequately dispositioned. It was sort of like a second look at all the discrepancy reports and how they were dispositioned and there were no unknown problems that needed attention. We also verified the configuration data to verify that all required modifications and mod kits had been incorporated and accepted and bought off by NASA Quality. We reviewed incorporation of field operation instructions. During the program, if we found a problem during testing that didn't warrant a failure report but warranted an additional inspection or additional piece of maintenance, there There was a plant field bulletin sent out to both JSC and KSC that required them to take action to implement that bulletin. We reviewed all bulletin closures to show that they had all been successfully completed on the flight hardware. Not a requirement of the program. We also reviewed all pressure, garm assembly, liquid cooling garment leakage test trends from the initial acceptance all the way through flight PIA. That was a series of trending charts that we looked to verify and see if there were any trends where leakage was increasing or there was a leakage problem that hadn't been reported and that was part of the activity that we did for all those missions and I think contributed to the success of the program. Now I'm going to get into describing some of the mission suit related data and I've got a handout here that I'll start with you sir that contains material swatches from the Apollo 7 to 14 IV suits there's four sections and EV suits I think there's two sections that are the materials that we use for the cover layer of the PGA. As you will see as I go through the missions, there were a lot of cover layer changes that were unique to each of the mission sets of hardware. First mission, Apollo 7, of course, was just a manned demonstration of the command module, an intervehicular Earth orbital mission with these crew members shown here. The significant changes from the A7L baseline that I presented in the last session, that we created a 7L CMP or Command Module Pilot PGA configuration, which had a special cover layer consisting of beta cloth and interliner and Nomex, no thermal insulation protection. We deleted one set of vent system inlet and outlet gas connectors. We deleted the LCG connector and the PLIS system mounting brackets. This eliminated the bulk and increased comfort for the crew members. In addition, for the EVA crew members, we modified the arms to eliminate the arm bearing and the elbow convolute so that it was more comfortable. These were done with the link net type arm from the Gemini program. It's a copy that ILC designed. And this improved the arm-shoulder interface with the crew member lying side-by-side in the couch. And that was the reason for that. So that was the configuration changes for that mission. Yes. Did the CMP suit have the bearings in the shoulder or did it not? Yes. It did. It retained those, but the CDR and LMP suits lost it. No, let's back up a minute. I need to correct what I just said. Okay. The EVA suits, crewman configuration included that modification. Right. Okay. But the CMP suit did not include that. Did not exist. Did not. Okay, very good. Apollo 8, these were the mission demonstration, the command module then, and a lunar orbit and return to Earth with these crew members, Frank and Jim and Bill, crew members here in their suits. The significant design change was that all the crewmen were used the CMP type suit that I just described that were used on Apollo 7, all three crew members. And in addition, there was a valve salvo device placed inside the helmet that was recommended by Wally Schirra, who had a problem during a cold he developed during the mission, and he needed to have the capability in a suited configuration to clear his ears. So this was provided with an attachment on the interior of the disconnect that was made part of the baseline for all crew member suits from that on. The commander"

So this was provided with an attachment on the interior of the disconnect that was made part of the baseline for all crew member suits from that on. The commander's helmet, Frank Borman had a problem with the polycarbonate shell size and the forward chin dimension. He had a hard time getting into the helmet. So we created a new size enlarged helmet to accommodate his head to provide for easier helmet donning and doffing. And this configuration was used for all subsequent new production helmets. So if you're astute and you still see old helmets and you might see two different configurations of shapes, you may wonder why do they do that? Well that is why. Jim, before you move on, the picture. The color picture shows the CDR and LMP with two sets of connectors on their suits. This is on 8? Yes. Your note says they all use the CMP type PGA. Well, before we flew, we modified the suits to do that. Okay. Huh. Okay. And it was very easily done to put the connectors in and out. It was a requirement of changing the vent ducting on the inside to accommodate that, but we had standard design sections that you could do that. And this, of course, was done at the plant, not in the field, and the brackets could be taken off in the field. And we put reinforced patches over the holes where the gas connectors and the water connector would have been. I see. For Apollo 9, which was a LM manned demonstration, first LM flight, where the crew member conducted an EVA stand-up, EVA out of the command module, and the lunar module pilot conducted an EVA out of the LEM. LEM transfer to command module was a mission objective, but it was not accomplished due to Rusty having an illness problem. But we were able to demonstrate PLIS recharge in the LEM during that mission. The significant design change, as I mentioned earlier, was a change to the TMG cover layer made to reduce flammability. Apollo 10 was a manned flight demonstration with a lunar orbit in return. Here again the significant design changes were made to the cover layer, made to improve abrasion resistance durability and reduce flammability. This of course is the EVA configuration for both crew members, I mean all three crew members. I'm sorry for the two crew members, command module and the monitor pilot. You see this here the gas connectors and the CMP pilot. Apollo 11, first manned lunar landing with the EMU's lunar demonstration. We all know who the crew members were for that, but a configuration change that was made was to reincorporate the arm bearings and elbow convolute to provide increased arms mobility as shown here. The helmet vent pad was changed to aluminum to eliminate the polyurethane foam that was covered by beta cloth as part of the flammability redesign activities and the vent connection and the back of the neck ring was modified so that when the helmet was put on and rotated you had a better slot opening for vent flow into the helmet. And the color of that neck ring was made red so there was no, and the helmet neck ring so there would be no connection of one color of the standard blue with the red, it was always red. That was mostly for ground use training that that was done. The Apollo 9 EVA, if you remember on Apollo 9, the EVA looked red, it was a red polycarbonate. And during unmanned thermal vac testing of that configuration, the polycarbonate draped over the helmet and was found unacceptable. We added a layer of multi-layer thermal insulation over the red polycarbonate. It's still there, but we got the thermal cover layer over it. And we added side retractable eye shades. And the sun visor changed to polysulfone, which was a higher temperature material than the polycarbonate used on Apollo 9. And from there on this visor assembly was called the LEVA, Lunar Extravehicular Visor Assembly, for the missions it supported. Apollo 12 had a whole list of mission objectives since we now showed that man could land safely and return from the moon. in terms of, in particular, deploying things like the ALSEP and the Lunar Experiment Package and learn how to work and do jobs in the lunar environment. The significant design change on this was we added a center opening and closing bill, like a baseball bill to the leva to provide increased visibility to the crew member from the sun shining down on him, especially when he's in lunar craters where there was a dark area in a crater and he was in the sunlight. And that was incorporated based on Apollo 11 crew's recommendation. Apollo 13 of course was aborted due to a command module problem. The crew was safely returned and the people that supported this, the SUP people, supported design and verification of the lithium hydroxide canister modification, the command module canister configuration for use in the LMAS lifeboat to provide environmental control system co2 removal and actual material used in around the canister was LCG storage bag ethylene material. Apollo 14 another lunar surface mission a A significant item related to this mission was that prior to flight, just prior to flight, we had a PGA-desk pressurization problem with a crew training suit, and the failure was traced to a boot bladder rubber rupture. Investigations showed that there was a common condition in most dip convolutes and bladders called reversion. This is a sample of what the shininess that it looked like that eventually led to rupture. And this condition was found in hardware older than 14 months. We looked at the total inventory of suit hardware, training and flight, control and uncontrol, to check this. and the decision was made just prior to flight to replace all the dipped boot bladders with newly dipped bladders, plus doing a detailed inspection of all other dipped components in the flight suit. This was accomplished within weeks of flight. It was a real strain on the personnel involved in that there were rules set up about when we could ship flight hardware back and forth between the IOC and the CAPE. We couldn't ship any more than flight suits at one time to ILC to have these bladders replaced and kept the backup flight suits for the prime crew at the Cape. And then when the prime suits were finished at ILC and shipped to the Cape and we arrived successfully, we could ship the backup crew suits to ILC and then back. And during this time I was given authorization to authorize a contractor lease Jetstar aircraft to fly the hardware back and forth between the Cape and ILC.

Like I mentioned, this was done within, I think it was like 16 days prior to flight. We were high on a list of what are you doing and when are you going to get it done? and are you sure you're doing the right thing? By all levels of management all the way to the top. At that time, we initiated a failure investigation to determine the root cause of the failure since we didn't know why this happened at the time. And the basis that we convinced ourselves that we were adequate to fly was that no evidence of the problem was shown in hardware that was younger than 14 months. And we did put a little pad on that, by the way. It wasn't, 14 months was what we felt secure with. Jim, was that, do you think, caused by the fact that the 14 launch was delayed because of Apollo 13? No. Oh, okay. It had nothing to do with that. This was prior to the real launch schedule. But the suits were still, I mean, the suits were not built before the expected launch and then just kept in storage for an additional year. No. Okay. The next session I'm going to present on Apollo 15 to 17, I will report on the results of the root cause failure investigation and what was done to correct the 15 through 17 and subsequent A7LB suits that were made to support Skylab and the ASTP flight. We did find the cause and I'll get into that. Next some of the flight PGA's experience for the flight 7 through 10. For the commanders there was their serial number and this is their leakage history. Pre-flight and post-flight showing that we did pretty good except for one case our spec was 180 cc's per minute pre-flight and the suit checked out at 200 and we had a waiver that was approved for that and we identified the cause which was a tiny nick in the pressure sealing closure and so we did pretty good for all I mean for all of those missions the pre-flight hours at vent pressure that were conducted with the crewmen in their flight suit. This is a flight suit only and at pressure. That's their history there. Jim, could you tell me what vent means? Vent is like 0.2 psi. It's vent flow rate but not pressurization. It's approximately 0.2 psi vent pressure. That's a pressure in the normal mode when you're not pressurized in the suit in the command module or limb you know it's just a normal wear pressure you have flow rate for co2 removal and for some cooling and so that was that and flight hours at vent and pressure of course Force zero was Apollo 8, which did not have any EVA activity. The minimum amount, which was a pressure check in the suit, conducted Apollo 7. Apollo 9 reflects the time in the command module during a pressure check and the EVA conducted out of the command module and LM, where all three crew members were exposed to vacuum. Apollo 10 again is just the pre-checkout time in the suit. Apollo 11, leakage criteria, really good. Apollo 12, post-flight, we had a failure which was a nick in the pressure ceiling slide fastener. good leakage rates post flight you know as we thought this was really good I mean leakage leakage was a big determinant in the use of the suit we ran a leak check before and ever every suit used training and flight no but normally the next to the pressure ceiling slide faster occurred during suit donning or golfing when a crew member tried to pry open the closure to get his body into it his head duck his head into it put it we had guests that's built in to try and protect the closure from that but sometimes that could happen also laying in the couch and scooting around on your back could cause that problem also we're not sure exactly what the actual problem was caused by. If they had had that kind of a leakage rate during the mission, would that have been a problem? No. Remember, this was post-flight and we did not notice any problem during 12 with the commander as far as suit leak rate during the EVAs on the surface. That would have been a problem had it been detected during the mission? I don't think so. I mean you're asking me to speculate and I don't know the answer to that question. We didn't have any problem during the mission with that leak weight we found post-flight. Okay. We did write a failure report to determine the cause at that point in time. But the mission was successful. There were no issues as far as effect on PLIS EVA time due to oxygen consumption. So, and the flight hours of course you see the crew members use their flight suits quite a bit during ground training in in the command module and LEM during their crew compartment fit and functional and and fit checks and crew training at bent pressure and this is your flight time and in the suit just some interesting data that I don't think many people are aware of was kept we had an acceptance data package maintained with every suit where all the test results were recorded and maintained unfortunately when we ship the flight suits to the Smithsonian they didn't keep the data packs that we know of so there's no way to resurrect this data again that I'm aware of I've tried we talked about pressure sealing slide fasteners and so how many were we replaced in the actual flight suit and you can see we had one Apollo 7 suit three closures in Apollo 9 and one on Apollo 10 that required removal and reinstallation that was conducted at the manufacturer's plant due to high leakage rate, mostly. These are the cycles that we kept record of at launch and how many times they were cycled during the mission and at landing. This is the same data for Apollo 11. We had one closure replaced in the Neil Armstrong suit before flight and a commander suit here and Apollo 14 we had quite a few closures replaced, five mostly all here again due to leakage and that's why I mentioned if you attended last week's session I mentioned that you should not use a pressure ceiling slide faster and design of a suit if you had a low suit leakage rate requirement and these were the cycles again at launch and at landing for the 11 to 14 suits. Lessons learned. This is a combination of lessons learned from the last session where they were not presented and today's session. The significance of crew members' induced load into the suit during task were not originally recognized during A6L and 7L testing. We had numerous structural restraint cable failures.

Lessons learned. This is a combination of lessons learned from the last session where they were not presented and today's session. The significance of crew members' induced load into the suit during task were not originally recognized during A6L and 7L testing. We had numerous structural restraint cable failures. When we identified this, we added a requirement in the A7L that we do, and during life cycle testing, we induced the man loads that would be expected during the performance of a task. and we recommend that the load cells be added in instrumentation to measure structural low pass and all future advanced suit designs to establish crew member induced loads. Now it wouldn't be proper to use the man induced loads that we did for the 7L suit in future suits because it's very design dependent upon how the loads are transmitted and received in the suit structure so that's why I recommend it for all future suit designs that you do that before you put a man in a chamber or in flight. PGA bladder molded rubber components self abrasion and leakage during flexure. This occurred during cycle testing and we added a reinforcement nylon scuff layer on the outside of the convolutes at wear areas that were identified during cycle testing. I use the word reinforcement here. The difference we use between a reinforcement and a patch is that a reinforcement was a patch that was required to be put on all suits as part of the baseline design. The patch was a unit fix for a suit that resulted from resulted from a known puncture like an accidental puncture with a needle or a knife or what have you that wouldn't be appropriate to make for all flight hardware. We talked about the pressure sealing slide fasteners. We had frequent factory closure replacements in training and flight suits mostly in the training suits due to leakage and we recommend that you establish a new entry design for future IVA and EVA spacesuits that have a little leakage requirement and of course this was done for the the shuttle EMU suit I'm not sure what they're doing for the Orion suit for if it has a low peak low pressure leakage requirement or not. They may have a problem if they use that design. We had limited flex cycle life of restraint cables and attachment switch fittings where the switch fitting flexing against the cable resulted in failures. These were structural failures. In fact, we had In fact, we had a problem during Apollo 14 that we found post-flight where a glove cable had failed at the wrist joint, which resulted in his wrist extension, which he reported during the mission. It didn't result in any loss of pressure, but it did affect performance. We recommended to eliminate all cables and swedge in future suits. This ended up being a requirement in the shuttle EMU RFP for the design of the shuttle hardware. Here again, I don't know what you all are using for the newer suits. We found lock locks were necessary at all pressure integrity connections. We had several instances during crew training where a connector, a vent connector might come out of the gas connector or a helmet might not be connected properly and locked in place that we incorporate lock locks on all pressure and integrity connections. If you take an examination of the Apollo suit you see that to remove the helmet it was necessary to grab a latch on the neck ring and there was a separate little latch on the top you had to push in that allowed the latch to be pulled out and then rotated to get the helmet to disconnect from the neck ring. If you looked at the gas connector, there were two little tabs on each side that you had to pull up simultaneously, both of them, and rotate the connector to get the gas connector nozzle to come loose. The same thing was true on the inside of the PGA at the LCG connector, where the LCG was connected on the inside of the suit. There was a separate lock that locked the LCG plug in place in the PGA so it would not come disconnected while the suit was worn. So that's something that was real important that we did and it's also was implemented for the shuttle EMU. Lunar dust particles contamination during the lunar surface EVAs. Post EVA crewmen in the LM found disconnects connectors become more difficult to actuate dirt to dust contamination in the connectors themselves as well as the RCU readout lens become visually obscured the crew member had to wipe it off to get the dust off and mostly around the lower suit surfaces here and he didn't show up too well but he was covered with dust here and it covered the cabin surfaces and atmosphere. So future suits need to provide some method to account for keeping the suit and the cabin free of dust contamination. I see that to be a big problem for future lunar surface activity and for Mars as well. Materials age life. We had a four-year age life on the suit, and unfortunately part of the major suit components, the convolutes and boot and glove ladders, were made with proprietary compound, rubber compound, that we were not privy to know what was in it. And it contributed to the Apollo 14 problem root cause that I'll describe in the next session. But anyway, we should preclude use of any proprietary materials in any future suits. That's it for today. These are the future presentations that I plan to prepare for and present to you over the next six months. So attached is a list of all the references in case you would like to check into some of the facts that I presented to you. So if we have any questions, now would be the time. Yes sir? A couple questions on life cycle testing. You mentioned the formula for where you came up with those numbers, say 20,000 shorter joint cycles. Was that the requirement and then you tested to some factor beyond that or was that equation the factor that included The equation is what we use to establish the total number of cycles required. There was a total number pre-flight. Added to that was two times the mission cycles, plus added to that was the contingency cycles. That was the requirement. Now, on most mechanical, when I say mechanical, non-suit-type hardware, they use a safety factor of four, some two, and we found that was not adequate for our use. So we went to the actual reviewing the video, establishing the, we established the cycles per hour, and then take the number of hours times the mission hours, flight hours, to arrive at the total number of cycles. So those numbers included the scatter factor or you then applied a scatter factor that we actually tested? The scatter factor was two times emission. If you want to define it that way. And then you mentioned that they originally attempted to do a mechanical joint cycle test mechanism and you felt that was invalid. It was invalid because it didn't induce man induced loads. It was just pressure loads. The man induced load is significant in the suit as to the way things rub together and rotate. When I say rotate I mean move together as opposed to just a straight flex one way. A joint moves in"

And then you mentioned that they originally attempted to do a mechanical joint cycle test mechanism and you felt that was invalid. It was invalid because it didn't induce man induced loads. It was just pressure loads. The man induced load is significant in the suit as to the way things rub together and rotate. When I say rotate I mean move together as opposed to just a straight flex one way. A joint moves in multiple directions and even a single axis joint has a slight movement off the center. And of course you don't get the max load during the cycle, you only get the pressure load and the max load exceeded the plug load in most cases in the design of the suit. And during shuttle we had an activity to define the max load with a crew member restrained in foot restraints, hanging on to a satellite EVA and trying to recover it, which was a maximum load that you could induce through the structure of the suit down to the boot. So it's a very significant load that has to be factored into the design of future suits. I'm sure Amy you're doing that, right? We don't get to work on that a lot. We're using shuttle numbers still because we haven't got to build a suit to test man loads. As I pointed out, shuttle numbers may not be adequate because the structure is different and the way the loads are transferred can vary based on the design. Any other questions? Do you favor customized suits? Do I favor customized suits? Well, it's based on the requirement, okay? As you can see in Apollo and Skylab and places where we use customized suits, we had a limited number of crew members that had to work EVA and have high mobility. The technology at the time required us to custom fit the suits to get the maximum mobility out of a given suit design. and when I mentioned the fit checks conducted at the manufacturer's plant part of that fit check was an adjustment of the suit cables which provided added mobility if they were adjusted properly to the crew members suited joints I mean for shuttle we didn't use a custom suit because it would have been prohibitively costly. At the time we made the decision we were at 60 flights a year with up to seven crew members per mission and you figured out how many suits you would need. It just would be economically not feasible so that's the difference. You got to base it on a mission requirement bottom line. If you're using in a suit for IVA only. It's not as critical to have custom as it is for EVA. Even with today's technology I think. So I'm in favor of custom suits for pressurized, long term pressurized suit wear. What? What? Probably. Probably. I really, you know, that's to be established. Probably, you're right, it might be like an Apollo mission. If we go back to the moon, it might be feasible to have custom suits. I think custom suits usually normally always provide better mobility than a standard size, but here again it depends on the suit technology. And for gloves, for sure, custom gloves are better than standard gloves, although we use standard size gloves in shuttle, and we did, unless the crew member required a custom glove. Okay, if there's no other questions, I would like to thank Jim for coming today."

        "text":"Document: Apollo_Block_II_-_Spacesuit_Competition_fad2fa19fb1e416397ce2c3661bc16ce1d\nTitle: Apollo Block II - Spacesuit Competition\nPresenter: Jim McBarron\nDate: September 2015\n Now I'm going to talk a little bit about the competition that occurred. As I mentioned earlier there were problems between the Hamilton ILC team and developing a satisfactory suit for the Apollo suit program. And as a result, NASA MSC, at the recommendation of the Crew System Division, implemented a backup suit for Block 2 with the David Clark Company. This was not the Block 1 suit. It was a suit that was unique to meet the lunar surface requirements of the Apollo program. And the criteria for that suit was to use the existing HAM standard ILC performance spec requirements. And the criteria to use that suit if it was met all its requirements and was significantly better than the Hamilton ILC suit was to be a selection test program. And the ground rule is that it would be used in the command module mock-up and the lunar simulation facility and the LM mock-up at that point in time. That was in January 1965. In June, MSC conducted a comprehensive test program. And these were all pretty important ground rules that are listed here. It was to be an evaluation of design, function, operation, and all the man-suit interfaces. Test connections were controlled to present identical test situations for each suit to try and be as objective as possible. The basic evaluation rationale emphasized mission requirements. Test procedures were structured to maximize objectivity in evaluation of the three different suits. Sixty-five separate evaluation situations were conducted and scored to determine which of the three suits were best for use in the Apollo program. Astronaut Mike Collins was the primary test subject, and an experienced test subject served as a second test subject. The second subject had almost identical physical measurements and strength as Mike Collins because each of the three suits that I'll show you in a minute were factory-sized and made to fit Mike Collins. Each test conductor and test subject scored each test and sublevel test results using pre-established weighting factors. Before the testing started, weighting factors were established by a committee representing responsible branch managers, suit engineers, astronaut Mike Collins, and the overall test program manager. So this program was trying to be as objective as possible and to cover as many operational and design conditions that could be achieved within the period of time that was allowed to do this test program, which was about two and a half weeks. It was conducted here at Johnson. It was conducted at Grumman. And it used the command module here at JSC. In your discussion about the Gemini suits, the David Clark Company had sort of come in at the last, had sort of an end around and picked up a lot of the best features of some of the other designs and then ended up building the suit. Was there some political backlash about David Clark getting this competitive bid for the Hamilton suit? I think the Hamilton ILC team did not like that fact. But the problems that were ongoing at that point in time in the relationship between Ham Standard and ILC as well as the product that was produced by that team, by that combination, were all inadequate and created problems that were not overcome at that point in time. And that's why NASA went ahead with a backup program with David Clark to take the best features of Gemini and the Block One and other suit programs that David Clark had going. Remember, David Clark also did the X-15 suit program with the Air Force and some other Air Force development programs at the time. So they had some additional expertise in suit design that was not used in Gemini or Block One at the time. The question was whether there had been any sort of political backlash for the way David Clark got the suit contract for Gemini. Not that I'm aware of. I mean, between the companies there was unhappiness, I'm sure. But, and that's it. This is the cover sheet for the test plan. I'd like to point out something interesting about this test program. It was run and approved by the chief of the space medicine branch in the Crew Systems Division. At that point in time in history, the Crew Systems Division also included all of the functions that now exist in what did eventually exist in the medical directorate was located in the Crew Systems Division and it was run by Dr. Larry Dietlein down here. So this, they took the responsibility for implementing this program to achieve more objectivity away from the suit branches branch that was responsible to develop the suit and put it in another branch to implement the testing and of course this this branch also includes people like dr. Feddersen and dr. Jones who were experienced in how to create a test program that resulted in maximum objectivity while still including people like the suit engineers Randy Hester, Jim Barnett, Jack Rayfield, Jim O'Kane at the time, Mr. Slight, our suit tech was involved for maintaining the suit. Here was the other suit subject, experienced suit subject and Ed Michael he was a physiologist that was part of this branch. So and practically part of that branch, the medical branch. So it was pretty much a mix of expertise in suits as well as the medical side of the family in the crew system division. This is the test plan content that would establish a total score. It was divided into three main categories, the basic functions of the suit, operational functions, and what was called engineering tests. And then over on the side was a little piece of comfort for each of the tests because it was subjective and in doing the suited test it was a feature in all of these activities. Engineering tests The tests included pressure drop, leakage, helmet vision, functions of components like disconnects, relief valves, physical dimensions, the weight, the inspection of the suit after each and every test, the proof pressure capability, and some centrifuge tests that were conducted. Operational tests, which were important, was reaching the command module, visioning the command module, reach and vision in the LEM, suit adjustment capability, command module LEM operational mobility, and some physiological tests such as CO2 war shot in a helmet and metabolic load test that resulted from using the suits. Basic functions were mobility and range of motion, eye-to-heart angle. This was a test to determine with the crew member in the couch subjected to acceleration when his maximum tolerance would be for acceleration using the centrifuge, maximum visual field of the helmet, hand dexterity, and functional reach. And these are the weightings between each of these categories and the sub-criteria weightings that were used to establish a total weighting for that specific category. So that was sort of the setup of the test. This shows a data sheet that was used. It was sort of interesting. This was used for each test that was conducted, and the rating score went from 0 to 17 with 10 being met all requirements and then not meeting requirements based on degree of meeting was from 0 to 10. And then from 10 to 17 is if the suit design or capability was in excess of what the requirement was, you could get an added score for exceeding the requirement for that test. This shows the potential where subtests were scored using the same score system from 0 to 17. More than 15? It went to 17. That was determined from the statistics person, Dr. Federson, to be the maximum that would be necessary to establish how much a test score or test activity would be possible. And remember, this was all subjective in terms of a lot of the tests. This was trying to minimize the subjectivity and"

This shows a sample form for comfort rating that showed the different categories in the sub-level that was evaluated, like skin irritation, abrasions, rubbing, pinchings, both vent and pressurized. They were scored. Pressure points, vented and pressured, comfort thermally, and overall comfort. Each of these was scored and then fed into the overall score for the comfort rating, which was only 7% of the total. Now, these are the suits that were used in the competition program. This is the David Clark. They called it the AX1C1 David Clark prototype spacesuit. It was developed under NASA contract with David Clark. It was actually a mod to the Gemini contract, Block 1 contract at the time. Developed from Project Gemini and Apollo Block 1 spacesuit configurations plus their in-house expertise. The design of the suit uses the single front fold gusset top entry closure here which was similar to the design that was being employed at the time in the Apollo ILC suits for the Block II application. Incorporated multiple composite gas connectors and a water connector shown here. These are the multiple connectors for Bend Inlet Outlet, two sets and a water connector. Now the reason there were two sets, there was a requirement in block two that a crew member always be connected to a functional life support system before he disconnected from a good life support system to another life support system. For example, in a lunar module converting from being in the lunar ECS operational mode to the portable life support system, the requirement was that your crew member would always be connected to a functional ECS system before he disconnected from a previous system. That's why there were two sets shown here. These connectors are provided by HAM Standard for use by Dave Clark in his suit. ILC type gloves were provided. I think these were actually manufactured by ILC as part of their early program. The helmet was developed by NASA JSC personnel. The helmet configuration, which is a bubble polycarbonate helmet, it employed flexible bearings in the shoulder. And what I mean by flexible, they were bearings only in the restraint layer of the suit and They were made of high density strong plastic which provided arm-side rotation but did not penetrate the bladder. They were not through to the bladder. They were strictly through the restraint layer of the suit. They employed bellows in the upper arm and the lower arm and bellows in the thigh and knee and integrated boots which was you know the Clark configuration this is at bent pressure with the cover layer only for the inter vehicular application does not have the TMG configuration on this suit. Back at that point in time the TMG or thermal macro meteoric garment for the suit was a separate jacket and pants configuration that would be worn donned and worn over the suit in the lunar module. So this was like an inter vehicular command module lamb wear IV suit configuration. This is the HAMPS standard prototype space suit called the A6H. This was the sixth model developed under the NASA Hamilton ILC contract. It was serial number 37. That gives you an idea of how many suits. This was a serial number of the suit. There were 37 suits developed by HAMPS standard under the NASA contract, 36 of which were done by Hamilton with ILC as a subcontractor. This was the sixth model developed under that program. There were multiple copies of the same model to provide for test support and development support under the HAM standard contract. So this is the sixth model developed by HAM Standard. As I mentioned, the suit contractor after the fifth model was changed from ILC to BF Goodrich. So this was a BF Goodrich configuration, BF Goodrich HAM Standard configuration suit and used the BF Goodrich technology for construction. As I mentioned, ILC was eliminated from the HAM standard effort because of contracts performance issues. These issues were overrun in cost, over time and schedule, lack of technical performance, all of which led Hamilton to delete ILC as the subcontractor. The design incorporated the front single-fold gusset top entry closure that was developed by HAM Standard and ILC under the early part of the program. It incorporated multiple composite gas connectors and a water connector, the reasons I described previously. The helmet was developed and fabricated by HAM Standard. It was a two-part constructed helmet with a polycarbonate lens bonded to a fiberglass shell. ILC type gloves were incorporated and the remainder of the suit was jointly fabricated by Ham's Standard and BF Goodrich and this was done not at the BF Goodrich facility but at the Ham's Standard facility. By this time Ham's Standard had developed a suit design and construction and fabrication capability in house based on their previous experience with ILC. What experience did BF Goodrich bring into the Navy? Well, if you remember, BF Goodrich was the manufacturer and designer of the Mercury suit and was the supplier at that point, at this point in time, of all of the suits used by Navy pilots for high performance aircraft, the Mark IV suit. So Goodrich had a good experience base of pressure suit background. They never had developed an extra vehicular suit, however. They were one of the competitors of David Clark and ILC. If you look at the big picture of history, there has always been three major suit contractors that supplied the Air Force, Navy, and NASA. And that was B.F. Goodrich, Akron, Ohio, David Clark, Worcester, Mass. And ILC, while not used by the Air Force, Navy, and Operational Flight Programs, were developers of suits for the Air Force and Navy that were never selected for flight programs. The first program that the ILC got selected for was with HAMPS Standard in the Apollo suit program back in 1961. Now there's a period of time here I'm not addressing. I originally had intended to, it was a period from 1961 to 1964 which was called the early Apollo space suit program between HAMPS Standard and ILC and NASA. And that's a period of performance, Cinda, that needs to be covered in a future briefing, hopefully. And I did not work on that program at that time, so I'm not a firsthand reporter of what happened then, to be honest with you. I didn't come on board until Gemini or Block 1. So, and there's, the NASA person that ran this program is very sensitive to what happened at that point in time. And there are Hamilton and ILC historians who are trying to figure out what happened during that point"

So, and there's, the NASA person that ran this program is very sensitive to what happened at that point in time. And there are Hamilton and ILC historians who are trying to figure out what happened during that point in time, but they didn't work on the suit back at that point in time. And so there's a period of time where the actual hands-on experience has sort of gone by the wayside with both HAMPS standard and ILC. And it's a difficult story to put together. I tried to do that and it was unsuccessful because I got conflicting information between Hamilton and ILC, as you might imagine. And I didn't feel comfortable in presenting that to you because I wasn't a first-hand reporter, so to speak. And what I've been telling you is, from what I know, is accurate and first-hand and can be substantiated if required. So I couldn't do that with that early program. So this was the ILC suit. This was the AX5L. This was an in-house developed suit by ILC, not under NASA contract or Hamilton contract. This was done by their own nickel, so to speak. And they asked that this suit be added to the competition. And, of course, NASA was not in a position to say no at this point in time. So this suit was included in the competition. by ILC request. It was developed from design concepts used in prior spacesuit development programs by ILC, not just the Hamilton contract program, but also in several Air Force and Navy and Republic Aviation and several other suit efforts they had participated in during prior times. It incorporated a rear entry Gemini type pressure ceiling slide fastener through the crotch and up the back. It incorporated a project Gemini type gas connectors because that's what they had available to them to use. It did not have composite connectors and they got penalized for that in the testing. It used a sliding cable shoulder, arm and hip leg mobility system both in the crotch and in the shoulders and this was the unique feature that I believe was the significant design addition to this configuration that had not been used prior in previous suits and I'll get into that a little bit later And it incorporated ILC developed gloves and a helmet that was designed, fabricated, and built in-house by NASA Tech Services. While this whole activity was going on, NASA was working on a new type of helmet, the bubble helmet made out of one piece poly blown polycarbonate to minimize leakage, increase visibility, and provide adequate protection in the acceleration mode. It had bump acceleration pads that could be installed inside the helmet during launch. And this was worked with ILC and the NASA test team, and actually they ended up providing a helmet shown here to ILC. This individual shown here is actually the guy who got credit for inventing that particular helmet, which was Jim O'Kane. These are the three suits at pressure. And you can see there's an obvious difference in the upper arm position and width, which was critical for use in the command module. It had a higher standing position with its design. All the suits used bellows in the arms and legs. The only difference here was the pressure sealing slide fastener was used and the crotch cable system. And the unique feature of this system was that once the suit was fabricated, you could adjust the length of the cables to size the suit properly to the man not only physically but for mobility performance. And this was done later as you will see. The Orlon suit uses a similar capability which I think they copied from us to be honest with you but I I can't prove that. It's my own belief. And these were the suits. And this was the results of the test after all those tests were conducted. In terms of the number of first tests, first places in terms of the score, which was the highest score for that individual test, number of seconds that they achieved, number of thirds. And as you can see, ILC had more first places. than any of the other two suits. And when the final scores were racked up with that weighting scheme, the ILC score came out highest in overall performance capability compared to the other two suits. David Clark came out second, and Hamilton came out third. And consequently, the ILC suit was first, Clark second, Hamilton third so that was the results of that testing now I'm reporting this because I didn't participate in this activity so I'm relying on the test report which I have a copy of one of three copies that no exist this was the actual tabulation for each of the events that were tabulated at the mid level the The number of first places by each suit, whether it's David Clark, Hamilton, or ILC, you can see the first places. Now the important ones were reach in the LM and command module, which they come in pretty good, ILC did. Suit adjustments, pretty high. Physiological tests, CO2 washout in the helmet primarily. Dimensions, minimum dimensions. Pre-inspection as far as the quality of the seams and the sewing and the bladder. They were penalized here. they did not receive a score for participating in a centrifuge test, so they got zero score there. And the reason they didn't participate is they couldn't meet the schedule because there was a failure of pressure sealing slide fastener that had to be replaced. Schedule-wise it didn't permit use in the window that was available for the centrifuge application. And even with that, they come out with a higher score. You said they were also penalized for the composite and not having a composite? They were penalized for not having a composite disconnect. Do you read the test report that is mentioned in there? There. So it's interesting that the pressure drop was zero. David Clark, they really got penalized because their pressure drop was so high. Ampstander came in first. They had the lowest pressure drop in the suit. There are some other interesting points here. That was their Hamilton's number one. I think that's the only one they had a one in. ILC had numerous ones. Clark had numerous twos. Leakage and a one here. They got to exceed requirements because when they delivered the suit, it was less than the required spec leakage. And if you look at some of the comfort scores, function, comfort in particular, they got a one. And that's because the use of the link net is a more comfortable suit construction technique which showed up in this test series. Any questions on the test? Go ahead. Maybe it's fundamental to everybody else here, but I think I know what a pressure-sealing slide fastener is, but I don't know what the gusset close is for the David Clark and the ham standard. What was"

Maybe it's fundamental to everybody else here, but I think I know what a pressure-sealing slide fastener is, but I don't know what the gusset close is for the David Clark and the ham standard. What was that like mechanically? It was the neck ring would flip back, and it would open a gusset fold that allowed the entry volume envelope to don a suit from the top down to get into the suit. and then you fold up the gusset to close up the excess material in the restraint and the bladder and then zip it up with the external structural restraint zipper to close it. So it's a little bit like the Sokol suit. A little bit like the Sokol. So the Sokol suit, I think, uses a tie to close it. They actually have a tie at the belly. Right, I see. Huh, very interesting. This was a, now in the early part of the Hamilton ILC program, this design K feature was always a problem in terms of leakage, and primarily leakage, and comfort where he had folds underneath on a chest. Because their leakage was so low. Correct. And IFC was penalized because of the leakage they had in the zipper pressure closure configuration. So there was an interesting program. As a result of this program, Dr. Gilruth, who was the center director, sent details of this activity to headquarters because it changed the NASA headquarters approved procurement plan for the Apollo suit. His recommendation was to amend the existing Hamilton contract to provide for the PLIS and associated equipment only. The contract would cover the delivery of all flight equipment for the Block II flight program. Secondly, to award a separate contract to ILC for development and fabrication of flight suits and associated equipment for Block 2 and JSC Crew Systems Division and Manned Spacecraft Center then to assume responsibility for total program management, system integration and spacesuit qualification. In order to accomplish that, the Crew Systems Division hired General Electric to be a contractor, SUIT-PLIS program integrator for the early part of the SUIT program. The basis for the director's recommendation on the prior page was the SUIT evaluation that I described to you, reassessment of ILC capabilities that was done by division personnel, and the previous difficulties of HSD's inadequate system development but recognizing their competence in the place. But HSD has just dumped ILC for their failure to deliver as a subcontractor. Correct. So now you're penalizing HSD because ILC wasn't, they were basically off developing their own suit instead of supporting the HSD effort. Well, as I mentioned, I was not a first-hand, unfortunately, I wish I was, participant at that point in time in the program. I don't know, Tom, were you involved in that back then? There were a combination of problems between Hamilton and ILC and one of the problems is that in an inherent process of doing design Hamilton was more traditional by the textbook design practice, whereas ILC was a cut and try girdle bra manufacturer. And ILC believed in trying it, fixing it, trying it, fixing it, whereas Hamilton was design it once and go build it. And I think that was an inherent problem from my perspective that created lots of other sub problems where they didn't agree on how things should be done. From talking with some of the ILC people that still exist who this particular individual ended up being one of the one of their presidents told me that HAM standard never allowed ILC to pursue some of the ideas they had that they should have pursued back during this early time as far as the design features. So the Hamilton ILC effort never got to full ILC competence, so to speak, in that activity. I mean, that is sort of my observation, okay, an observation of one of the people that I still communicate with at ILC, who was a first-hand participant, okay? And anyway, in November it was announced that this was implemented and ILC then proceeded to provide the spacesuits for all of Block 2 from Apollo 7 all the way through actually Apollo 17 and also for ASTP and for Skylab. So that pretty much winds up this except for some lessons learned I did want to share with you. It's important at the beginning of a program that between a spacecraft module and a space suit contractor that physical and functional interface control documents are established very early in the development process. One of the problems in the early part of Apollo is that this was not done for various reasons, one of which was neither spacecraft contractor or suit contractor fully knew what the real requirements were at the onset of the program. And so as the program evolved, requirements evolved, and there wasn't an adequate system for controlling the physical and functional interfaces. And before this activity occurs, a full ship set of development hardware needs to be provided to the spacecraft manufacturer to verify the accuracy of the interface design. That's real important. When I say ship set, in this case it would have been three suits to North American early in the program. Later on, three suits were provided to North American, two suits were provided to Grumman, one suit was provided to Draper Labs for navigation, interbase, optics interface. Next, this type of test plan procedures could be a good analysis tool for future competitive evaluations and decision makings of not just spacesuits but any type of piece of equipment where you have competing designs that need to be evaluated, that are subjective in nature, and you want to maximize objectivity. So that's sort of any questions on that? These are my recommendations. Next, I'm proposing this, just for your info, to take care of Apollo 7L spacesuit development through 7 through 14, which includes the lunar landing and Neil Armstrong's use of the 7L suit on Apollo 11. I was about to ask, the ILC suit looks nothing like the images I have of the Apollo program. So was it the fire that changed things? Fire changed things enormously, and I'll get into that. The ILC suit program went from a 5L to a 6L, and that's when the fire occurred. They had the 6L was gonna be the flight configuration then. After the fire, there were requirements for non-flammable materials, the separate jacket and pants, thermal micrometric garment were integrated. I mean, a lot of changes, and I'll cover that in this next briefing, assuming the Senate gets funding and get approval to do this. So hope to see you next time. You got me hanging here. I have a lot of this. I was the contract tech monitor for all this activity, so this is really firsthand, and I've got a lot of good data and stuff that's one of a kind that don't exist anywhere"

Are there any other questions for Jeff? Just a comment. There's probably several folks that have seen the video of moon machines, the spacesuit. And it was before my time, but it talks about some of that. It interviews a lot of folks from Hamilton and ILC, and you might get a flavor for what was going on in the US. I have those videos, yeah. Unfortunately, the people aren't around anymore that did a lot of this. 50 years ago. And knew what was going on at the time. I mean, there's a lot of busy bees that were implementers that didn't understand what was happening, but the key players are gone at ILC and at Hamilton. Yes, sir. My background is in suits as software, but it's interesting the cultural differences that you talk about because in software development you have waterfall development methodology, which is define all of your requirements in detail and then start coding, and then you have newer forms of development methodologies, which are agile development, which basically is you code, you test, you code, you test, you code, you test. You have a lot of short iterations, and you evolve your requirements as you evolve your software. And they are two different cultures that operate very differently, and sometimes they don't see eye to eye on that, and it seems very similar to what you're talking about here. From my observation, Hamilton was strictly in engineering by the book. You go to college, learn how to design and implement. You can't go to college and learn how to design a spacesuit. There's no textbooks yet. And it's more of a cut and try. They use engineering principles as well, but the basic fundamental, you build one, you test it and change it, You build another one and improve upon it until you get what you need. It's interesting that it's almost as though once ILC was freed from the strictures of Hamilton, then they could do things completely their way, and then that's how they came out on top of the competition. And I think that's what happened. My friend who is a former president of ILC who was an engineer at this point in time, That was his make on it, too, was when they got the freedom to do what they had previously recommended to Hamilton but not accepted. And to NASA as well. There were NASA people involved in this that were part of the problem, okay, I believe. And it wasn't strictly a twosome. It was a threesome that was the problem. And, yeah. Thank you."

My name is Cinda Chullen and I'm the Knowledge Capture Manager here at JSC, Johnson Space Center and I'll be serving as your moderator for today. I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Hank Rotter and today's webcast. The title of the webcast today is the Orbiter Water Dump Nozzle Redesign Lessons Learned. Hank is the Technical Fellow for the Environmental Control and Life Support System and will provide the causes and lessons learned for two space shuttle water dump icicles that formed on the side of the orbiter. He will present the root causes and the criticality of these icicles along with the redesign of the water dump nozzle and lessons learned during the redesign phase. I'd like to give you some indication of Mr. Rotter's biograph. He's had a career with NASA at the Johnson Space Center since 1963, and I have the privilege of saying that he's been my personal friend and colleague for my 32 years with NASA, and I feel very privileged and honored to have him as our guest today in the Knowledge Capture Program. I would also like to thank Hank because Hank is a primary supporter of the Knowledge Capture Program. He is really the person who makes Knowledge Capture happen for us in the area of life support and spacesuits. Mr. Rotter graduated from Texas A&M University in aerospace engineering before he started NASA. But once he started, he hasn't stopped. He started out as a mechanical and stress engineer at the flight acceleration branch in crew and thermal systems division. He worked on the manned centrifuge, drop tower, and vacuum chamber. He also was the task director for those facilities as well. In 1968, he moved to the Apollo Environmental Control System as a subsystem engineer for the entire Apollo mission through the Apollo-Soyuz test program. That was in 1967 before the first one. Oh, wow. That's really... I must have a mistake. No, that's okay. So but anyway, he proceeded on through the Apollo program and continued on working as subsystem manager, environmental control, and really worked tremendously through that Apollo program focusing on life support systems. Then he moved on into the shuttle program and worked environmental control and life support systems there as well in multiple jobs associated as that would be the responsibility of the subsystem managers at the time, which includes pretty much every problem that would take place. He's also been the point of contact for two orbital tunnel adapters for the design and implementation of the orbiter. And in 88, he became the Orbital ECLSS, the Environmental Control and Life Support System engineering work package manager and division chief engineer for those systems. And this is what's remarkable. Hank, I think this is just one of the greatest things because of the wide range of discipline that you cover, all the way from crew equipment to crew escape systems, extravehicular activity, space walks, and the ECLSS mission and payload integration. those systems he covered and became the engineering team lead for those things and in future programs like or other programs like the extended duration orbiter and then he moved into more responsible positions and all those disciplines he moved into division chief engineer and then he just kept adding more responsibility and more responsibility through his career as well as dealing with the International Space Station, the Russian Space Station Mir, and then finally he became the division manager for all the ECLSS and active thermal control. And I have to say today he is really recognized as a NASA agency technical expert and of course Our agency has recognized that. In 2003, Hank joined the NASA Engineering and Safety Center for the Discipline Experts. And he has not only become the technical expert, he is the technical fellow and the NASA capability lead for life support and active thermal. Hank, I can't say enough about how wonderful it is to have you as an expert here at NASA and to have you as my friend and colleague. I just really wanted you to be able to share some of your key experiences with the audiences here at NASA. And I want to thank all those that joined us today. And this is a rare opportunity that you have to have live interaction with Hank and ask the questions you'd like to ask. So without further ado, Hank, thank you so much for being here. I'd like to turn it over to you and have you share with us this subject matter for today. Thank you. Thank you, Cinder. You embarrassed me a little bit. And I got to live up to that now. Okay. As Cinder said, we had STS-41B and STS-41D shuttle missions. The 41 meant they happened in 1981. And we farmed icicles on two of these two missions on the side of the orbiter. And so I'm going to tell you how the mistakes we made that made this happen and the lessons learned from those two mistakes. And then some of the mistakes I've made in correcting or redesigning the nozzle. And so there will be maybe four or five lessons learned in here. So why this was critical, if you go to the next page, this is showing almost the same configuration or angle of attack in this picture as we fly into reentry through the ionization burn. if you see where the two dump nozzles are right where the arrow is pointing and the ohms pod which is in the back the reason it has black tile there on the ohms pod that is where the ionization burn comes over the edge of the leading of the wing right below the nozzle and impinges on the ohms pod it also means those two nozzles are aligned, that was the ohms pod When the icicle came off in 41B, it had several hits down the side of the arbiter in line to the ohms pod. It had three hits on the ohms pod, one hit on the tail, and I think three or four hits on top of the wing. On top of the wing was not critical. The tail was a little bit critical, but we didn't do any damage there. But the three hits on the ohms pod crushed the ohms pod structure underneath the tile as a composite. And we crushed about a square, a little more than a square foot of that composite. The only thing that was holding it there was the wire mesh that was inside the composite. And fortunately, we did not knock any of those tiles off. If we did, it would have been a bad day. If you go to the next chart, just a side view of the orbiter showing what's internal to the orbiter. And if you look at the ohms pod, which is right below the tail, it shows a propellant tank, two propellant tanks and two oxidizer tanks. And behind those are three small helium tanks. and if we would have penetrated with ionization burn through that, we would have caused those tanks to start popping or blowing up. And so back to the first chart. So after 41B, it was my job to start redesigning so this wouldn't happen. And I'll talk about 41D a little bit later. In 41B, the icicle formed in a vacuum is about 80% or a little more than 80% of solid ice. We dumped 250 pounds of supply water. At the same time"

In 41B, the icicle formed in a vacuum is about 80% or a little more than 80% of solid ice. We dumped 250 pounds of supply water. At the same time, we were dumping 120 pounds or a little more than 120 pounds of wastewater. The wastewater was half urine and half condensate, humidity condensate that we collected. Somewhere in the middle of the waste dump, the waste dump and the supply of water started at the same time. Somewhere in about the middle of the wastewater dump, we started forming an icicle. When I went to the Cape and looked at the side of the orbiter at the end of it, the urine solid footprint on the side of the towel showed me that it was over a two-foot ablong diameter. pattern over the two nozzles and they're both of the nozzles over at least eight inches apart and and we later on when we did testing in a vacuum chamber I can estimate based on the base size that the icicle at least five feet long so I estimate there was close to 200 pounds of water of ice in this icicle post landing um i've you know we've that's when we found where all the hits were and um during this mission i was trying to get the flight directors to allow two eva crewmans to go look down the between the hinge line of the payload door and uh and the side of the orbiter to see what what what we had on the nozzle i knew we had something on the nozzle but i didn't have a clue at the time how big it was and and they they refused me because they didn't you know they didn't understand that this would be critical as i said on this page is we crumbled the port of the tile on the homes pod and we had no tile missing thank god and and now the flight directors when they saw this they realize how critical this was so so the first lessons learned originally when we designed to do the water potable water and wastewater system dump system we had we had two cabinet two regulators and two relief valves in an independent system the regulators were to keep the tanks pressurized at 15.5 to 17 psi D above the cabin pressure. And when we were dumping or using water in the tank, these regulators would maintain the water on the tank. And then there was two relief valves set at 17.5 to 20 psi D to relieve that pressure as the fuel cell water came in and refilled those tanks or as we filled the waste water tanks. So we went over-pressurized and we went under-pressurized. Now, our design was never for a dual dump. But in this 41B mission, they did a MOD to save time, did a short, or Mission Operations did a short dual dump and decided, well, we could go do the second one, the much longer one. The short one wasn't long enough to drop the pressure below the regulator's minimum pressure of 15 above the cabin, but the long one did. And each regulator had a max flow of 1.2 pounds an hour. And that was not enough flow rate to keep a dual dump nozzle water tank pressure, maintain the water tank pressure. Also, at the same time, we used the flash evaporator that evaporated water in a vacuum for extra cooling to supplement the radiator cooling. And at the same time, the flash evaporator was drinking water from the supply water tank B. So that was another additional pressure drop. When we stopped the water dump, the water tank pressure was down to about 7 PSID above the cabin. And I have, prior to that, analyzed there's a 22-foot line between the tank, well actually 22 feet in the payload bay and 7 feet in the orbit or below the orbit or mid-deck floor. So out of all of that line length, we would lose half of the water tank pressure at the dump nozzle. So when I'm calculated by the end of this last, at the end of the dump, we were almost down to 4 PSIA at the dump nozzle. And the normal flat edge dump nozzle, which we had, had about a 60 degree spray pattern. and as the pressure dropped, that spray cutting started widening. And as it widened, it started more and more ice would impinge on the side of the orbiter and start sticking and then it formed a footprint of ice near the nozzle, which is the nozzle face is two and a half inches in diameter. and we've started forming ice on the top, which has no heat transfer, so the ice stuck to it, and then it bridged across the heated nozzle. And once it got into the primary spray pattern, then everything from then on was ice. And I don't know whether it started on the supply nozzle or the waste nozzle first, but it quickly impinged on both nozzles. And now we were building a big icicle. By the way, we did a, the flight controllers did a second supply dump in the next day morning. And I could, the two nozzle temperature minus two degrees F, which is the lower limit of the temp sensor. and when they started dumping the nozzle out of the supply, I saw the waste water nozzle increase to 32 degrees. We were flowing liquid water underneath the icicle to the other nozzle. So the first lessons learned, we operated the system differently than it was designed, and we didn't do our analysis to determine why that it was okay. We got too busy about saving time for crew time, which is really important in shuttle and ISS missions. Two flights later, 41D, this was the first flight of Challenger, the second orbiter and it had TPS or thermal protection at frizzy blankets on the side instead of the towel and the blankets were about half an inch thicker than than the towel and and this to to when they built the the blanket around it they stitched it down to lower it near the surface of the nozzle as then you can see in the picture and that stitching and and and and the valley was the nozzle and it was ideal trap to click catch ice and and in the 41 B we had to set the trap. This time the trap was already set. All we had to do was dump water. And this time the flight directors paid attention to me. They learned real quick after this. We had an arbiter arm down almost 60 foot long down the side of the of Palo Bay, and we pulled that arm out, extended it over the side of the orbiter, and took a look. And this is what we saw. This is the second day after the first day. We put the orbiter in an attitude where we were shining sun on the wing,"

This time the trap was already set. All we had to do was dump water. And this time the flight directors paid attention to me. They learned real quick after this. We had an arbiter arm down almost 60 foot long down the side of the of Palo Bay, and we pulled that arm out, extended it over the side of the orbiter, and took a look. And this is what we saw. This is the second day after the first day. We put the orbiter in an attitude where we were shining sun on the wing, sun on the side of the orbiter, and we only melted about less than a quarter-inch surface that was in the sunlight. So we knew we couldn't get rid of the icicle by sunlight. So the training guys fired up the training arm on the ground, and they went and practiced how to get the arm to move down the side of the orbiter and bump this icicle off. This icicle, if you see where I got the supply nozzle, is up underneath the main part. They did a small wastewater dump and told them to stop it immediately, and we formed a little bit of ice off the waste nozzle, and the white circle in front, it was the vacuum vent nozzle where we depressed the airlock through, and that was about a 2-inch diameter nozzle. The Arbiter supply in wastewater is only 0.056 in diameter. So very small. But in the same time, while they were training with the arm to do it, we built a nozzle set up in our small nine-foot vacuum chamber, put a crewman in a suit in there with him. No, put a technician in a suit or an engineer in a suit next with it. And I told them how to go make the icicle happen, and they started making icicles, and they got one that would only get about a foot and a half long in a gravity field. And then we used a scale and a weight pulley system to measure the force it took to pull the icicle off, break the contact of the icicle from tall, I mean from my frizzy blanket, excuse me. And that force was like a few pounds. So we knew we could use the arm to bump the nozzle, this icicle off, and not hurt the arm. So after this, it was my job to go redesign this so this wouldn't happen again. I did a bunch of nozzle designs. I did different types of heater control configurations around the nozzle, and I tested both with Tal and F-Frizz. In fact, this is my Tal fixture, what I had with the nozzle right in the middle of it. and the tile got a little banged up over the years. That's why the black glassification coating is still not on it. And then I had the TPS guys build me a frizzy blanket. This is only a half inch versus the one and a half inches on the orbiter, and we put the nozzle in the middle of this so I could test both with the tile and the blanket. The good news, I found out the black tile, I had a sun lamp in the chamber to simulate the sun, and also to help melt ice off it so we could do the next test point. And I found out the black glassification coating had less of a traction for ice than the Frizi. so so that so when i did the first dump in the chamber uh was the old nozzle that had a cold wall 20 feet away and facing the nozzle and and two cold walls on each side of the chamber that was also 20 feet long um when i sprayed at that that cold wall the was the old nozzle i had over a six-foot diameter, almost an eight-foot diameter spray pattern on that nozzle, on that wall. And then when I tested a sharp edge nozzle, it was less than two feet in diameter spray pattern. And my memory is not pristine here. That might have been even smaller. But at 50% of the pressure, I dropped the pressure to 50% of what the orbiter would have had. And there was no change in the spray pattern. Now, that told me I had a design solution. And the reason I picked the sharp edge arfor is I went and talked to the machinists and the metal urgers who use water jets to cut metal and also the etched metal, and that's what they use. So I had some people design metal nozzles, different configurations, and none of them worked good, but the sharp edge was really, really the answer. so I directed Rockwell to drill out the current straight edge if you go to the next chart this is the old nozzle design I don't know if you can see it but there's a the last quarter inch of flow path is a straight edge path that was old five six in diameter so we and the line going into it was a quarter inch so We just took a quarter-inch drill bit, drilled it out to where the end of the drill bit would be a sharp edge design. To explain a little more about the nozzle, the shot slot, the long vertical slots behind the shaded area was 22.5-watt heater calls. The line going into the nozzle had a heater call wrapped around it. And at the top you see where the arrow is, there was a sensor well. Actually, there's two of them there. One of them is 45 degrees off from the other. But there were two sensors wells that would tell us the temperature near the orifice. So this is my hand-drawn drawing, Dr. Ray Cutler. I mean, Ray, not doctor, but Ray Cutler was the draftsman for Rockwell. And this is the drawing he made to direct the nozzle vendor to redesign this nozzle. And the mistake we made, we did not have that one-inch depth on the sensor weld. And at the time, we kept the old sensor well depth, which is not clearly specified in the drawings. And when we drilled the line out to a quarter inch, we broke through to that sensor well. And we built two nozzles, put them on the orbiter, and went and flew the next mission. and all of a sudden I saw where I had evidence of one temp sensor dropping out of the four sensors on the two nozzles, one sensor dropping in temperature as we dumped water, and I realized I had a leak path through the sensor well where occasional water would go through, and I didn't cause a problem. And so Rockwell and the vendor, the nozzle vendor, both suggested putting a braze plug in the bottom of the sensor well that was one to two-tenths of an inch long, I guess I should say. And we put brazing around it that was more than a mil thick, or maybe a couple of mils thick, in fact. and I assumed and I got sorter expert here and I don't know whether it was sorter or braze I don't remember but I'm pretty sure it was braze and I assumed they had talked to a braze expert at the vendor and at the Rock"

Here's the Afrizi design, blanket design. This is the old on the left, and then on the right, we had the tile tapered up at least a tenth of an inch above the Afrizi blanket height, so the nozzle face was above the Afrizi blanket, So there was water. When we come through, there's always one or two little water beads or ice beads that wants to move horizontally. And I watched probably 100, at least 100 water dumps after all of this on the Arbiter with the arm and did all the different scenarios and different configurations, even dump water at the cabin pressure only. in case we lost the nitrogen pressure on the water tanks. And everything looked good. So this is the black tile around the two nozzles. This is an angled view from the arm. And if you can see it, there's a little pencil line coming from the lower nozzle across the yellow, which is the waist nozzle right above the wing. and that little pencil line is proof that the sharp edge is working good. That spray pattern is almost a zero-degree spray pattern. The next page, then I forgot which flight this was. The date's down there, but don't tell me what year. but this we we changed made a mod in the to the orbiter and the down parrot this orbiter and a down parrot and and they worked around where the nozzles were three flights later payload we were flying attitude where the payload bay door got very cold. The temp sensor underneath the white tile here, or that white blanket, I guess I better say white blanket, was minus 100 degrees F. So I know the temperature on top of the blanket is even colder than that. Water stable temperature in a vacuum is, in a hard vacuum, is a minus 140 degrees F. So for ice to stick to a surface, that surface in a vacuum has to be colder than the ice that approaches it. If it's warmer than the ice, it generates a vapor or causes the ice to supplement and form a vapor barrier, and it just ricochets off. So when I looked at this, there are several. So I guess the third water dump, we farm ice on the door on three dumps. And then third dump, we were going to look at it with the arms, flung the arm out, and we see this unicorn building toward the dump nozzle off the door. And we told the crew to stop the dump. We didn't do anything with this icicle. We lost about a third of it in the next week of the flight. and there was still ice on top of the door when we closed it. And when the orbiter landed on the ground, there was still some of the ice on top of the door. The temperature of the top of the door during entry is less than 100 degrees F. So there wasn't a high temperature to melt it. So the lessons learned, next chart. No change is simple. All changes must be integrated with the other systems that it packs. So you must do your integration of all the changes. The TPS guys changed the blanket, made a blanket design, and never said a word to me about it. I didn't even know it happened until we launched and flew. And when I looked at their design, if I would have saw that beforehand, I would have known that was a trap for ice. And you must fully analyze, test, or assess all new off-nominal operations, which was why we had the big pressure drop. And then us engineers are not expert in all techno fields. When you make a design change or use a different technique, You must contact somebody that's an expert in that technique to make sure you've got a good, appropriate design change. Speaking of, and this is when I'm talking about the braze material, and when we built Node 1, when Lockheed and ISS program built Node 1 coal plates, they had a dimension error on a drawing, and they had the brazed material two mils thick. And when we proof pressure all those cold plates, they all developed leaks. And so I had to help them redesign that. But they didn't talk to me ahead of time. I was after it. So questions? Hey, Hank, we did have someone that submitted a question. They said they believe that that occurred in late 1992. They worked on that flight. You mean the unicorn bicycle? Yeah, the payload door, ice buildup. Yeah. Since that comment was directly related to what you just talked about, I just wanted to inject that. Thank you. Any other questions? I have many more lessons learned, but I hope someday I'll do some more of these. Maybe what you can do is just provide us with some final words about lessons learned and some advice that you might share just from your own personal viewpoint. Well, first of all, this nozzle flew on one of the Mars science missions, a mission that ordered into the Mars, unfortunately, because they were going to dump their cooling loop before they went into Martian atmosphere. But I fully integrated with those guys and helped them locate the nozzle and everything, not to impinge any ice on any surface. I did also work with the ISS guy with their water. They"

Well, first of all, this nozzle flew on one of the Mars science missions, a mission that ordered into the Mars, unfortunately, because they were going to dump their cooling loop before they went into Martian atmosphere. But I fully integrated with those guys and helped them locate the nozzle and everything, not to impinge any ice on any surface. I did also work with the ISS guy with their water. They've got the same nozzle on ISS to dump the early days of the condensate water. And then I reviewed all of that and made sure they didn't impinge on any ice and that they had the appropriate design to not create ice. I took the responsibility for this because I spent two hours explaining one day, explaining to the flight directors and the engineering directors that I knew what I was doing here and that we would never make ice cycle on the side of the orbiter. And knock on wood, I kept my promise. so um the um you gotta learn lessons and you gotta watch other engineers to help make sure they don't repeat it now that is not easy and there are times people do things and you don't even know they're doing them and which is like the cold plates on the node one But I helped them redesign it and recover from that. And those cold plates are still on ISS today. As I say, no design change is simple. Every design change has pluses and minuses. I was taught in the early days in my presentations to early to Apollo managers and before that on any design changes or changes we wanted to make is to tell the program manager the pluses. First of all, why he should want this. But the second thing is you should tell him what the negatives are so he makes the right decision. because we do risk management all the time, and you want to know what the risk of every design change is. Okay. Well, we had another question. We had a really \u2013 this is a very good one. Can you clarify the physics that allow for the formation of the icicles in space? And then is it that the liquid water immediately evaporates, then freezes, then adheres to the surface? First of all, I looked at the ice we dumped in the chamber. There were little round spheres, and there were hollow. By the way, a little bit of hollow. And they were porous. When we dumped water through the icicle, we would always, the icicle, as you grow the icicle, there was always porous past through that where the footprint of the nozzle and the length of the nozzle kind of grew out like a volcano except we were a sharp volcano but but there was always paths for the ice to flow through all of that so it didn't have a strong structure now why what happens at the arfas at the nozzle as it exits the nozzle it drops to to the vapor pressure or the triple point of water immediately and you evaporate some water to cool the water down to the triple point and 32 degrees F and triple point and now the pressure wave that's generated by that steam determines when at the triple point you can you can ice water can exist as a liquid solid and and gas and as the as that water continued out it would form the edges of the droplets would freeze as ice and it would have a gaseous and liquid on inside and which continued evaporate and supplement and and until all the water now is solid or gas and if you do the thermal analysis for heat of heat evaporation and and heat of vaporization i'm not saying the right terms but but those two would determine how much ice you made and it's approximately um if i'm been too long since i calculated this but i thought it was near the 80 percent number also that you would 80 of the water you would dump or 75% in that range would become ice. But you've got to look at the water temperature coming down, how much it takes to evaporate to cool it, and then how much it takes to freeze it and how much it takes to evaporate it. So you balance all three of those against each other, and that determines how much ice you make. And there's a burst factor in the spray pattern, and what determines it is the pressure wave of the initial vapor of the water. And usually it's about four to, in the main spray pattern, it's about four to six inches away from the orifice where we call it a burst. And at that point, there's only gas or ice, no more water vapor. And if you remember correct, I said there was a liquid flow on the first one from the supply nozzle down to the waste nozzle, eight inches away. That means we flowed liquid water in a vacuum to that eight inches underneath the icicle. And the icicle is not forming a pressure barrier. It's all porous, so we were able to keep the water at that point, at the triple point, the triple pressure, point pressure, which is 0.08 psi, and actually flow liquid water to the other nozzle. So I think that answers the question. Thank you, Hank. Oh, we do have another one. Don't ask me when I'm going to retire. Yeah, so what's the rumor there, Hank? No, don't. I won't do that. I won't do that. I want you to work as long as you want, Hank. That's awesome. Anything else, Hank, that you would like to share with us or anything? Well, one of my things I tell young people and young engineers, if you want a job to be fun, you have to work at making it fun. And I work hard at making my job fun. So I have a lot of fun. The mistakes a lot of programs make up early that don't have a good integration control, a good integration team to integrate all changes. That was what was great about Gemini. I mean, yeah, Gemini. I mean, Mercury, Gemini, and then Apollo. Our managers learned how to integrate. Our contractor, Rockwell for Gemini, and then Rockwell for Shuttle. I mean, Apollo learned how to integrate things, and we had a great integration. And we had Heritage and continued into the Shuttle program. Unfortunately, shuttle program lasted long enough we didn't have managers extend to the next program. So there was some early integration problems on ISS and also on Space Explorer. But you reminded me of one thing while you were talking. In the vacuum chamber testing, I had about eight test points I was going to test. I presented my plan to the division chief, who was Walt Guy at the time. And Walt's famous line is, you did not look at all the variables. And he said, you're designing for the two failures you had, but you've got to look at all the other variables. I did have a couple of other variables in it. So I added about 20 test points as I went in through the testing. I were able to eliminate"

So I added about 20 test points as I went in through the testing. I were able to eliminate, I think, two or three of them as I learned. But the variables, which is also the pluses and the minuses of every change, is the things you've got to look at. And when I've done the other thing is when I did design reviews, I did a ton of design reviews with Rockwell and GFE. world I keep trying to get crew systems invite me to the GSE GF government furnished equipment design reviews I try to ask the question on every chart and the main thing is that what I want to the engineer to tell me is what he did behind the chart how he got to with the words he has on that chart so by asking the question he starts talking about what he did and how he built how he come up with the design solution he had on the chart and that's very important you need to know that the design engine or whoever presented the data did their homework and did look at the other options and and pick the right option so that's the my only other piece of advice i have well that fits right That fits right in Hank with the next question that we have and it goes right in with design. And the question is what were the design drivers for the nozzle heater design and what temperature did they operate at? Well that's a good question. First of all in the chamber the nozzle I was testing in the chamber did not have any heater on it. We did have a heater on the line feeding the nozzle. So I did the worst case scenario with the nozzle with no heater on it. And I was dumping water. I started a water dump at minus 20 degrees F on the nozzle and we had no problem dumping. So I stressed the nozzle design as much as I could. Now the wastewater, when we dump wastewater, the spray pattern is a little bit wider because we have urine solids in it and it's half I mean urine in it excuse me 50% of its urine and urine has a lot of dissolved gases in it that comes out of solution and when that gas comes out of solution when you dump it it widens the spray pattern so we we had to treat the waste nozzle a little more carefully than we did with the supply nozzle because of those dissolved gases. The supply water had, I mean, the wastewater has about 20% by volume of dissolved gases, of the water volume, up to 20%. It's normally, depending on the crew diet and stuff, that it varies between 15% and 20%. The supply water was saturated with hydrogen from the fuel cells, and that was at the maximum of 2% by volume. So we didn't worry about the supply of water, but the wastewater would initially widen out, and you would get a spurious particle coming across the nozzle face. And so what we did was heat the nozzle to 400 degrees, no, excuse me, 300 degrees F, I mean 250, excuse me, I'm trying to remember, 250 degrees F before we started the dump. And the nozzle, we would continue the wastewater dump until the nozzle temperature dropped down to 60, up to plus 60 degrees F. On the supply water nozzle, we would heat the nozzle up to 100 degrees F and went, to give you an example, the difference. And as we started dumping the supply water, the nozzle would continue to heat from 100 degrees F to 100 and stable out around plus 140 degrees F. So you could tell the supply nozzle was not getting any contact of ice on the nozzle face, but the wastewater nozzle definitely did. So we always limit the wastewater to that temperature band to ensure that we weren't getting any ice to stick on the nozzle. Thanks, Hank. That was great. I really appreciate answering that question as well. We had another one that just came in. Let me see if I can get that one. All right. This has to do with waste dump pitfalls. Do you have any recommendations beside nozzle design to support dumping 100% urine using only cabin pressure as the source of fluid back pressure? And are there any specific pitfalls to avoid? Well, we did that in Apollo at 5 PSIA, but we had the nozzle was the same arbut size, but the nozzle was a dome, a semi- spherical dome that stuck up above the thermal protection surface, and there was nothing in the view of that nozzle for anything to ice. So if you're dumping 100% urine, which we, in the shuttle missions to Space Station, And we separated the condensate to space station to recover that water. And we almost ended up with 100% urine in the wastewater tank. And we dumped that with no problems now, but that was still a 15 PSI above cabin pressure. if you're dumping it at 15 psi cabin pressure long as you have the nozzle face higher than any nearby surface and nothing in the view of the spray pattern for ice to stick you should be okay i had to really look at iss location to make sure there was no solar panels or radiator in the view of that nozzle that we could impinge on. That was, of course, I would think after 20 feet, I didn't have to worry about it, but we still look for a location on ISS not to spray toward any other surface, any other module or radiator or solar panel. Anything else, Hank, on that one? Not that I know of. just make sure you don't spray toward any other surface. Okay that's good. Well at this time we've concluded all the questions that have come in. There's no other ones that I have and of course I could ask you 100 questions but we're pretty much out of time today Hank and the goal would be to have Hank back regarding other lessons learned. So what I'd like to do is I want to thank Hank for helping present this Orbiter Water Dump Nozzle Redesign Lessons Learn event, knowledge capture event for us today, and all his in-depth knowledge associated with that, and thank him for answering any questions that were generated throughout the presentation and at the end. Also, I want to say, Hank, you know, should somebody have a question maybe they thought of after the presentation or maybe they went back and reviewed the video and thought of something, you know, I would like to invite them to, if they still have questions, go ahead and send them in and I'll forward them to you, Hank, so if you have an opportunity to answer them, we'd really appreciate you doing that. I'd be happy to. That's great. I think that this"

You know, this presentation from Hank may have spurred some ideas that you have about other lessons learned that might be important, things that Hank would be familiar with and could share with us. Hank has more stories to tell, and I know this because I've talked to him multiple times, and every time he starts out talking, I want to say, Hank, we need to have the recorder running on this topic because pretty much Hank will give you the answer that is, that is, will share with you lessons learned as he provides them to you, even in conversation. And so we're striving to work with Hank to get him captured on this topic and other topics as well. And then so but if you can share that with us and document that you have a need to would like to know about these topic areas That supports our position as well to get Hank Get him recorded and get it get the knowledge capture that he has so that we can really preserve Hank From a legacy standpoint and so that way we always will have the video even if you decide to retire Hank So with that, I want to thank you, Hank, from the bottom of my heart that you have joined us today and shared your technical expertise with us and with the audience today and providing it through this mechanism that will prepare this legacy for you for a long time. I would also like to thank those folks that have helped with the knowledge capture and allowed us to preserve these events and conduct these events and prepare for these events particularly I'd like to thank my true friend and colleague Bladinko Oliva for helping me she's vital to running this program she's the knowledge capture administrator and I really could not have a knowledge capture program without her she's invaluable and likewise I would like to thank my colleague from current thermal systems division from the IT standpoint John spring grady he has been truly valuable and making us connected from a JSC standpoint and then from I'd like to thank our NESC colleagues that we work with from from a knowledge capture standpoint as well. I want to thank Ian Bockelder and Daniel Hoffpower. Both of them are integral to conducting these sessions and archiving them for us. And what I'd like to do is communicate that Ian and his staff up there at the NESC is archiving this lesson and other knowledge capture lessons for us, including our legacy lessons that we've pre-recorded. The NESC has now become the primary archival location for all of our spacesuit knowledge capture items and other topics that we've included in that as well. And those topics are now part of Hank's Hank's technical expertise and discipline. And so they're archived under Hank's discipline. And so I wanna thank you, Hank. I wanna thank you, Ian, your team for archiving those and now really making this knowledge capture program more toward a lessons learned program that has become valuable to technical experts throughout the NASA community. And as well, one of the things that we strive to do is make these events publicly available for folks that don't necessarily have NASA network connection, so that if we have partners, say in commercial crew or other areas that are maybe support contractors that don't necessarily have network connection, they can seek the benefits, as well as family and friends can seek the benefit of reviewing these knowledge capture events. So I want to thank the team for making this happen. Thank you Hank for the lecture today. Thank you for supporting the Knowledge Capture program. And with that, this completes the webcast today and thank you all for participating as an audience."

My name is Pekah Khan. I'm a reporter, photojournalist, author for over 20 years. And it is my distinct pleasure and honor to be here to introduce to you and interview Mr. Joe McMahon. He is a retired NASA engineer of spacesuits and related systems working in aerospace for over four decades. He continues to work as a consultant for NASA and other organizations in such areas as failure resolutions and historical perspectives, which is why we're here today, the Knowledge Capture Program. He is a 1959 graduate of Notre Dame with a Bachelor's of Science in Chemical Engineering, and he continues to use the skills that he has acquired over these years as a volunteer to help people, especially at St. Vincent de Paul. So we're very happy to be here. Thank you for coming. Thank you. And I would like to know right off the bat, did you ever in your wildest dreams think that you would be working on spacesuits? No. Well, never. I was always interested in science, particularly chemistry. So I got in engineering, and I tied for valedictorian in high school. We didn't have a big high school, 73 in the senior class. I tied for valedictorian. I had this idea that, you know, I had something on the ball. I got to college, ran up against a brick wall. I got three pink slips, which was notifications of failing. And I went to a counselor. I thought, this is it. I'm going to flunk out. All my dad's worries are going to come true. But I managed to stick it out. I got through three years and almost through three years without ever flunking anything then I flunked organic chemistry my theory up to that time my philosophy had been I may not make good grades but at least I've never flunked anything after that my philosophy was modified you're never really a student until you flunk one and then come back and pass it So I flunked organic chemistry out of 56. I couldn't believe it. I came back in the next semester, senior year, I got it all together, I got an 86. So I graduated, I was 17th out of 34 chemical engineers, safely in the middle. We started out with 180 freshman year, we graduated 34. Great. So how did you like working for Langley? Did you find it more satisfying? Well, I was working on Mercury. We were working on Project Mercury. I was part of the space task group which had around 80 some people. So we were working on Project Mercury. The guy I worked for, Frank Szymanski, he was at CAPE. So he had nothing for me to do. At this time they were letting, they had just let the Apollo contract and North American aviation won it. GE had been a bidder and so I got the GE contract proposal to read. They told me, read this and I wondered later why they picked GE proposal since they were a loser. Then the answer came to me. The rest of the proposals didn't stand any higher than about that. The GE proposal was about that high. So that would take me much longer to get through that. So I I started reading in the, I was working in environmental control. So I started reading and I, alveoli. What's alveoli? So I started looking at that, looked that up. And then atelectasis. What's atelectasis? I can't get out of the A's. You know, here I am working for this guy. I can't even get out of the A's. So then Frank came back and sent me down to the Cape. Why? It was down there for John Glenn's flight. So I went down there and I thought, what am I doing here? I don't know anything. I was down there representing him. So the morning of the flight, there was the Atlas out there, 109D, big Atlas, lights on it. I go down there and I want to go up and get close to it. So I go in and this guy, he has controlling access, he has a clipboard, grabs my badge, looks at it and says, okay. So I boss must have Frank must have called him got me got me access. I went down there walk right up on the pad It's close to the boosters from here to that door Everybody wearing a hard hat except me there's a mr. McDonald head of a McDonald aircraft who built mercury there is a BJ McNabb Convair hit of Convair built built the Atlas I'm there with all these guys. I'm walking around. Man, this is great. So then I see what we call a roach coach out there. Man, I could use a cup of coffee because it's just about 5 in the morning. It's starting to get light. So I go out. I get a donut and some coffee, and I'm going to go back out, and the guy stops me again. You're not on the list. Yeah, but you just let me in before. He said, yeah, I misread your name. It's a guy named McNabb. You weren't as important as you thought. Yeah. Years later, one of the guys I worked with at Liquor Carbonic said, they had made a movie, Friendship 7. He said, were you on the pad at Friendship 7? I said, yeah. How did you know? He said, I have a shot of the pad, and I can see this red-haired guy. You're the only guy without a hard hat. I can see your red hair there. That's great. So you never know. You never know. You never know. That's wonderful. How did that change you when you got that close, and you were like, I'm really in the space program? I didn't really realize it until later. I didn't really realize it until everybody made so much about it that I had been there. And the thing that I still wondered about for a long time, why did Frank send me to the Cape? I couldn't do it. I didn't know anything. Later on, after a couple of more trips, somebody would say, I need to go to Hanger Estuary somewhere. I said, oh, it's over here. I need to talk to someone. I said, oh, yeah, he does it. He sent me down there so I could start getting familiar. But he didn't tell me that. He just let me pick it up on my own. to start learning about it because that way it would come in handy later. So that's what I've learned. Anytime you go on a trip, never pass up the opportunity to take a trip and make contacts, learn about people, ask questions and all that. I was so dumb at the time. Didn't really know to do as much as I should do. Have you carried that with you and learned from that lesson? I tell people now on projects, you have a prime contractor and you'll have a subcontractor and maybe a third tier. Go visit that third tier guy. Walk the line. Look how the stuff is being built."

I tell people now on projects, you have a prime contractor and you'll have a subcontractor and maybe a third tier. Go visit that third tier guy. Walk the line. Look how the stuff is being built. Learn some of the names. You get a tremendous perspective there that you don't get from your prime contractor and from your subcontractor because they have their own biases, their own baggage and all that. They've got their own agendas to try and keep you away from it. But you need to understand that. You need to know. It's the same philosophy that one of my bosses said, I want all my engineers to take a ride on their hardware. That was Dick Johnston. So everything I was ever responsible for, I tested. It's amazing the perspective you can get, the user perspective. I knew one guy, he was one of the contractor guys. He was head of the potty, the shuttle potty. I asked him one time, I said, have you ever used a potty? He said, well, no. I said, what's more natural than using the potty? I mean, here you are responsible for the space. Why not use it? That's great. You don't have to go out of your way to find a reason to use it. So that was a lesson I carried. Always do that. So how did you get to Houston? Well, when we were at Langley, and all at once this rumor came around. They were going to start something called the Manned Spacecraft Center. so all the smart money said well obviously they'll put it at greenbelt maryland you know that would be the obvious place because a lot of the the goddard was there a lot of the the the guys that had formed the space task group had come from from there max figet and all these people had come from there so obviously it's going to be there then they set up this place called a relocation center. And then these signs started appearing around the place. Houston is a good place to live. Average temperature, 72 degrees. So then they set these, you had these little aircraft flights. You could go down a Martin 404 and a Convair 440. You could take free rides down to Houston and find a place to live. So these guys started bringing back stories from Houston. A guy said, it's flat. It's flat. It's so flat you could see tomorrow. Another guy said, you know, I was pulled up to a stoplight the other day and a guy pulled up next to me while we were waiting for light to change. He pulled up a guitar and started strumming a tune. Welcome to Texas. And they started talking about the cockroaches. I mean, people have them as pets. I mean, you can put saddles on them and the mosquitoes. You can hear them coming. It sounded like a plane landing. What did your mother say? My mother said, Houston, your clothes will mildew in the closets. She was right. That's it. She was right. What year was this about? 1961. And where was the program? It was just beginning with them. What were they doing here? Well, there were 17 different buildings. So we came down to the Lane Wells building. and we had security was there, life science, it was life systems division then. They also had the medical was part of life systems. I think security and personnel were also in that. What was the atmosphere and the ambience like? In the early days, for example, in Mercury, we, like Frank Samosky, who was my boss, he was in the control center. He was in MCC, Mercury Control Center. And when they built the control center here, we still did that at first. Then they broke that apart and made a flight operations division, MOD, Mission Operations Division. That was a traumatic thing. Why? Because we had been controlling it all. We were able to design the hardware, test the hardware, and go support it during flight. And to give that up. So we still did some work on the consoles supporting during Gemini. We still worked shifts, especially Gemini 7, the 14-day missions. You'd work an eight-hour shift and go over there and spend eight hours in the control center. So it was a 24-7 job, sort of, at that time? During that time. In fact, a lot of times there would be no, the passes wouldn't be over any stations, but you'd still be on station. And I remember we used to dread it when Gene Kranz was a flight director because Gene would come up with these problems and you'd have to solve them. And, I mean, they were worse than anything you could ever. One of them was the metabolic rate was higher than we'd planned on, which caused more lithium hydroxide to be reacted into lithium carbonate, more water to be collected in the canister than they planned on, which changed the CG of the canister, of the 14-day canister. So we were supposed to calculate in the environmental control world how much the CG shifted, and that CG shift would be passed over to other people who would calculate the change in a landing point. I mean, it was horrible. So you wish for a flight problem because they were much easier than what Gene Kranz would get. Well, what was the most exciting part of your job at that time? Like, I know you love Ray Bradbury, and that kind of piqued your interest. Yeah, in space. So did you feel like, oh, I'm living my dream? Not really. Not really. Did it not sink in yet, or was it not that space-oriented? Were you still working on the ground? Well, we had a project over at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio. They were going to put together an environmental control system and take two guys and put them in this chamber, and they had partial dawn suits. What we're going to do, we're going to look at, in a 5 psi oxygen atmosphere, and being able to take off, like, arms and legs, would the suit be habitable and comfortable for 14 days? This was for the Gemini mission. So we had two Air Force guys. So they needed an environmental control system. So a guy named Larry Bell and I, we got a hold of some old Mercury suit compressors from the Mercury program and some scrap heat exchanges from the Big Joe thing. And we looked at that, and we looked at just some car heater cores. So the technology was like stone age. We put these things together. Unfortunately, 13 days into the 14"

And we looked at that, and we looked at just some car heater cores. So the technology was like stone age. We put these things together. Unfortunately, 13 days into the 14-day test, they had a fire. And both guys almost died. What year was that? 1963, September of 63. What did you learn from that? It's what I didn't learn. Okay. Not then and not later. And that's the essence of this whole knowledge capture thing, is to recognize when knowledge is being shoved in your face and to take it in and absorb it and make it part of your being. Didn't do it. And I wasn't the only one. Everybody knows that oxygen promotes combustion. You don't realize what it will do to you until it happens to you. That flash fire was over in seconds. They couldn't get to these guys because they were sealed in a chamber. To pass in food and stuff, they had like a torpedo tube that they would equalize. They'd put stuff in it, equalize it with chamber pressure. They had no easy way of getting to those guys. They didn't die. They had severe lung damage from smoke inhalation because the chemicals that were given off during the combustion, it wasn't the fire that got them. Not the smoke. It was the smoke and the chemicals in the smoke. So the message was loud and clear. Hey, folks, oxygen is a hazard. Later on, I think in 64, Republic Aviation was running a test for NASA by PSI oxygen. When was this? I think it was in 64. Okay. This had already happened. They were running a test. They had a fire start and a guy started to put it out with a rug. Asbestos fibers held together with cotton fibers. Well, the asbestos didn't burn, but the cotton did. There's two messages right there. You need to be careful. What happened in 1980 when there was a fire? Let's don't go there yet. Let's go. If you want to trace this. No, I do. And I don't want to go all the way to 1980. I was just concerned about that to see if they were. 1980 is critical because it was when it got bad enough. So we had these two instances. We had the Apollo 1 fire. never did pin down you know exactly what happened but again there was the message that materials need to be controlled cleanliness needs needs to be controlled uh or you or you or you could have a disaster i can remember people then materials uh control new uh materials one time mcdonald came in we've got this new material wire insulation it is the greatest polyolefin wire insulation. So they brought it in. Will not burn and all that. So Larry Bell, same guy that worked with me at Brooks, they were passing samples around. So he got his cigarette lighter. Back then everybody smoked. He got his cigarette lighter. While the guy is talking, Larry lights this thing on fire and brings it up while the guy is talking. Polyolefin insulation died an instant death. So that was the Apollo 1 fire. you think that would have gotten your attention. In 1966, we were dealing with a 7,500 pounds per square inch oxygen bottle on the Gemini program, a system I was responsible for. And we had a check valve leak. The check valve was on the fill line for the 7,500 PSI line. We pulled it apart. We'd had a fire in there. It didn't blow anything up, but it burned other materials off, and that's what caused the check valve leak. a few weeks later we had a another fire of the same type on a unit that was down at the cape getting ready for flight so we cleaned things up real good we we uh decreased our fill rate to keep the temperature down and and then we flew and in the meantime we changed the design of that check valve to get rid of the stuff that would burn but still those were just you're fixing just You're band-aiding it. You're band-aiding it. Then we had a fire in the Apollo oxygen purge system. Had a fire in the lab. Technician was burned. Hardware was damaged. Still, fix those problems. Fix the design. Then April 14, 1980, we were getting ready for a chamber run on the EMU. a guy named uh john samus called him dusty dusty samus was the test was going to be the test subject we were getting a unit ready in the lab i was the backup test subject and a guy opened the valve to the high pressure system and it went off burned him over a third of his body second third degree burns destroyed a million dollars worth of hardware well dusty was was going to be the next guy to open that that valve if he would have been sick and i would have been the next one to open Then we got the message, you need a spec, global spec to control material selection, design, testing and control of high pressure oxygen systems. In fact, all oxygen. So we finally put together the spec. So all the knowledge was there all along, uncaptured until it got bad enough. Almost 20 years. Wow. Do you think fire is still the biggest threat? It is a threat. Anytime you have high pressure oxygen, I mean it's, you have two schools of thought really. The schools of thought over at Marshall Space Flight Center, and they dealt with high pressure oxygen, they dealt with liquid oxygen, which of course has got oxygen concentration higher than you do with high pressure. They control materials, control all processes but then they went ahead and assumed you were going to have a fire so they had all their ground support equipment all had fire stops in it and all that. We didn't do that. We used, we'll lessen the risk at an acceptable level by controlling materials and processes and designs and all that. So there was a difference in philosophy. And in fairness it's a little easier for them on some of their systems, especially the ground systems. Everybody's ground systems are easier to do because you're not weight critical and all that. So with oxygen, I mean we're always going to have highly concentrated oxygen as long as we have people that are going to operate in space. So that's one of the hazards. Radiation or other hazards. There's all kinds of hazards. But the thing that was striking about that was that we had the message several times early, and we didn't react fully enough. And that's the problem in not getting to root cause. People talk about root cause, but root cause is the underlying process that has a defect or doesn't exist. And that covers"

And that's the problem in not getting to root cause. People talk about root cause, but root cause is the underlying process that has a defect or doesn't exist. And that covers not only your problem, but everybody else's problem. If you fix just your problem, you're ripe for something else happening or someone else is right for that problem happening to them. You can fix your own piece of it, but if you don't step back, especially an agency, if an agency doesn't step back and fix the overall problem, then all you're doing is waiting for the next manifestation. Was that one of the biggest challenges that you've had in your career? The biggest challenge was standing there looking at the guy that was burned over a third of his body and talking to him. The next part of the challenge was talking to the lawyers that were trying to sue over that. How did you start with the spacesuits? Like when you knew that was going to be your long term goal. I started in environmental control systems on Apollo. And then the Gemini program actually started after Apollo. The Apollo contract number was NAS 9150. The Gemini contract number was NAS 9170. So it actually started. And the reason it started was to prove out rendezvous and docking because the first approach for Apollo was to have a direct launch, have a big booster called a Nova that would be water-launched. And that turned out to be not feasible. So then they said, well, we'll launch pieces up and rendezvous and dock them in orbit and then go on from there. To prove out rendezvous and docking was really the thrust of the Gemini program. It started out as Mercury Mark II, and then it became its own program. Well, they had these full opening doors on Gemini, so we started saying, hey, why don't we do spacewalks outside that too? So we set up something called the Gemini Support Office. We had an Apollo Support Office that worried about spacesuits and life support systems and other tools and gear like that. So they set up a Gemini support office, and they needed somebody to head it. So somebody leaked it to me that I was being considered to be the section head. Man, this was great. Well, then nothing happened for several weeks. I thought, oh, man, I wasn't even thinking of it before this. Now if I don't get it, I'm going to be furious. But I ended up getting it. and uh so we started out i i have the world's record i think for cost growth on a program a percentage wise we started out with this program before i was on it was going to be two little mercury bottles and regulator and they were going to spit it into the suit and you have a pressure relief valve on the suit go outside for 15 minutes 133 000 was going to cost because all the contractor was going to do was package it and put it together. Then they changed that in January of 64. We had a semi-closed loop with an ejector for circulation and an umbilical from the spacecraft and all that. Well, that jumped at a cost up to $700,000. Just a little. Then I came in in April of 64 after all this was started rolling. And then pretty soon, I mean, the contractor one time gave me this button, a million dollar, 1M on there. proud of it. We've gotten the cost up to a million dollars. He was proud of that. I was trying to hide it. I took that button and put it in the bottom drawer. I didn't want anybody to see it. I didn't know what I didn't know. We thought, what about spares? We added spares on. What about ground support equipment? We had to add ground support equipment. What about field support? What about contractors coming to help us when we get this stuff? I'm not going to know what to do. Add that on. This wonderful thing called incremental funding i just kept writing pr just writing purchase requests and somehow they kept finding the money we got to the end the contract ran out at three and a half million so it went from 133 thousand dollars three and a half million doesn't matter that i came in i mean that's the the sons and daughters inherit the sins of the parents so when you come in on a program no matter who started it, it's yours. From then on, and it's your fault. See, management hands can only get around one neck. So there always has to be somebody whose fault it is. And you realize you can't blame a committee, the head of the committee. That's why you have heads of committees. That's why they're called the head. Yeah. You get the head. That's right. So what was your next challenge in spacesuits that you thought, I don't know. So from what I'm understanding, you were kind of winging it at the first. You're being very charitable. We winged it all the way through. And the system was lousy. The system was under-designed for the job it had to do. The suit was not really designed for extracurricular activity. It was very hard to work in. The system itself, the life support system, had an inherent limitation on how much heat it could actually remove. And also how much CO2 it could remove. We had on Gemini 11 indications that the crewman was suffering from high carbon dioxide concentration. In addition to having sweat run down their eyes and all that, it could not handle the heat load. We had inadequate training simulation on the ground for most of Gemini 11. We finally came up with underwater simulation to try and get a handle on what it was really going to feel like when you got outside in zero gravity. But the early parts of Germany, it was just horrible, just the things that we did wrong. What was the biggest failure? No, I won't call it a failure. What was your biggest challenge at that time? Failure is fine. The biggest, well, there wasn't one biggest. It was across the board. The type of contract we had. We had an incentive contract, for God's sake, on this. Which was, and when you have an incentive contract, it seems basic that you and the contractor need to agree on what the target is. So you can see if I'm below it, I get this much. If I'm above it, I lose. What it turned out, after days of arguing, we finally communicated to the extent that what we were considering the target, the contractor considered the best possible he could do. So you can see all our argument. We were talking about penalties and all that"

We kept telling him, you can make all this extra money if you ship it early. In his mind, there was no way he was going to be able to ship it early. So all he stood to do was lose. So that was the failure of the contract, the failure of the system design. The program itself wanted to do so much. The program's eyes were much bigger than its technical stomach. We wanted to fly with the astronaut maneuvering unit free of the spacecraft on Gemini 12. We tried to fly it tethered on Gemini 9. We couldn't even get it out of the stowage fixture. So our goals went from this down to just this. Gemini 12 was going out and very carefully, very slowly working and trying out Velcro stuff and trying out foot restraints and just being very cautious and careful. We were just, in retrospect, we were so ignorant. How is it different today from then in the fact that now everything is, I don't know, but is it more micromanaged where they're broken up into more groups and in your day it was a few people that did a whole lot of things? It was a few people who did a whole lot of things. Sometimes they did it well. Sometimes they didn't do it so well. There's advantages and disadvantages. The thing that happens with any organization is that organization, as an activity, catches up with you. And usually it means you end up having a lot more watchers as the program goes on. SR and QA, all kinds of people watching what you're doing. And then it gets harder and harder to do stuff because you want, the idea is, I want to minimize risk. I want to minimize, I want to maximize, I want to minimize risk. You know, and it almost gets to the point where you say, I want to have zero risk. I mean, that's the logical terminus of this is I can have zero risk. You can't have zero risk, but people act like you can. and I want 100% accountability every dollar, every ounce, every pound, that you can have 100% accountability. So you lose flexibility as the program ages and becomes strictured instead of structured. And some of that's inevitable. The thing that happens, though, is that the bar keeps getting raised. that, like for example, we went to the moon a half dozen times. We didn't stay there very long. Our next plans for the moon were to go back with more people and stay longer. So you can say, well, you've already been to the moon. You've done that. You haven't done it the way they were planning on doing it. And that's the problem. The bar gets raised higher, and some of the constraints also get raised. So it makes it much more difficult. So technology advances, and that helps depending on how you use it. You can have a technology that ends up weighing you down. I mean, nothing beats your brain and a pencil and paper as a starting place. All the iPods in the world can't take the place of an original thought. And if you don't have time to do that because you're reading 1,200 emails, if you don't have time to do that original thinking, then you end up just spinning your wheels. So technology is obviously a two-edged sword. How do you think life support systems, the problems, the challenges, how have they changed from when you started working on those? What were the greatest challenges then? The greatest challenge then was just getting them to work. You were doing EVA as essentially a stunt. I mean, you can argue with that. And in Apollo, it was a one-shot deal. I mean, you go up there, you left the portable life support system on the lunar surface. You had the sublimator sized big enough so that as the porous plate degraded, you'd have enough left at the end to satisfy your UVA. We changed that philosophy when we went into shuttle. We said we want to make going into space, spacewalking, routine. We want it to be safe. We want it to be available to a wide variety. We don't want to have custom suits for everybody. We want to be able to satisfy a variety of people. We want to reuse this hardware over and over and over and over. Right. So making it something that was safe and reliable repetitively. Also trying to decrease the cost of checking it out, trying to get it reliable enough I don't have to check it out because every time you check it out, you put a cycle on it. You know, and every time you look at something, you're going to find something. I had one guy said, we went to a two-year cycle for pre-installation acceptance. And we were going to open this unit up. And he goes, please, please don't open it up. It's working fine. I said, well, if it's working fine, why do you care if we open it up? Because you'll find something. You'll find corrosion. You'll find something in there. And then it's going to shut everything down. I had a boss once that would not let you test close to flight. Really? Would not be able to test. Opening a can of worms, huh? If you had a failure on that unit, you could say, well, wait a minute, he's blind. Maybe he's blinding himself to a problem. Hey, I'm just saying that was his philosophy. When you get close to flight, you don't test. What do you think of that philosophy? I think it's... Got its merits? Well, I hate not to know. Yeah. But sometimes knowing, you know, I have a saying, don't ask the question if you can't stand the answer. Some dire consequences. Yeah, and you've got to be willing to live with it. Anytime you run a test, you can either get the answer you want, the answer you don't want, or an answer you don't understand. Two out of three are bad. So your odds aren't good. Your odds aren't good. So you need to go into testing with your eyes open. Tell me about the Gemini program as CSD support. Well, we had, as I said, the Gemini support office and the Apollo support office. Now, Apollo was the big brother. He"

Your odds aren't good. So you need to go into testing with your eyes open. Tell me about the Gemini program as CSD support. Well, we had, as I said, the Gemini support office and the Apollo support office. Now, Apollo was the big brother. He had everything. He had most of the money, he had all the publicity, had the prettiest secretaries, everything was flowing to Apollo. in competition essentially for test resources. We want to run a test. Well, Apollo's testing it. Hey, we're flying now. They aren't flying yet. Yeah, but they're Apollo. So we had that. And of course, when you have that, a lot of times you find out something. Keep it in here. I ain't going to let you know about it. So there's that problem of communication. That's one way to organize. Another way is the matrix where you have one like a suit organization. and some guys support Apollo and some guys support Gemini and all that. We didn't do it that way because, I think, because the Apollos got started before Gemini and they had to already be up and running. So we set up essentially a different organization, a mirror image. And one thing they did during the Gemini program, which I guess worked to their advantage, was they turned it into an incentive contract with McDonald's. The EVA stuff was all government furnished. to McDonald's. When they constructed that incentive, they constructed it in such a way that McDonald's could lose money if our hardware didn't work right. So something over which they had no control could take money out of their pockets. You can bet they watched us through a magnifying glass because we were going to cost them money. I remember during a flight readiness review flight readiness reviews you'd have a table that was you know eight or ten feet wide maybe 30 feet long you'd have people all around the table headed by the guy running the frr in front you'd have people in the back you'd have in gemini we had the the uh the air force there because they ran the titan you had mcdonald um all these people there and i remember i was getting up and making my uh my presentation on my system all at once this guy they said are there any questions anybody have any input yeah he pulls his brief briefcase up opens it up starts pulling out a strip chart a strip chart record from a chamber test we've run months earlier yeah i like you to explain why it's a regular it's totally blindsided totally out of the box I managed to explain my way out of it. I don't know how. Well, tell me what happened when the hose was dismantled, came apart for Apollo, the testing of the backpack. Well, he wasn't on the backpack. This was Jim LeBlanc. He was hooked up to a chamber of environmental control system on the suit, and he put some tension on the hose and popped it off, and he went to essentially chamber pressure before they could bring it down. He said later he could feel the, I guess, I don't know whether the spit was actually boiling in his mouth, but it was certainly losing the air. Oh, my God. And it was something so simple. It was a smooth pipe. Now, usually, and always in these days now, we have a little bead on that pipe. So when you put the hose over it, you put a clamp on it, and if the hose starts to slide, that bead on the pipe stops the clamp. we had a hose clamp but no no no beat on the pipe sounds so simple so simple but those are the things that usually get you um what about the uh the um testing of the suits like did you have to put them on oh yeah try out everything yeah i did that and uh another several of us did it uh one day it was we had what we called a phone booth this was a a little chamber and it had a liquid nitrogen that you could circulate through the walls of this chamber to give you a cold environment the way we generated a metabolic rate we weren't we weren't as sophisticated as now we had a step you walk up and down a step so many times every few seconds in fact they they mount a clock right outside the chamber window and they'd have tick marks on tell you when you were supposed to step So when the second hand would get around here, you'd step and you'd make sure you got so many steps in a minute that would generate a certain metabolic rate, which you'd done in a pressurized suit outside the chamber to establish. So Norm Prince was one of the guys in there. He was in this chamber, in this phone booth doing his testing. It turned out some guys were working overhead. We had this chamber that Norm was in. They just put in this new equalization piping, like 12-inch piping, over to this other chamber, the eight-foot chamber, which had the door having to be open, and a guy was working in there. And they were working on this valve that connected these two chambers. So obviously the valve was shut because our chamber over here was at vacuum, where Norm was. So you had vacuum all the way up to this valve, and then atmospheric pressure everywhere else. And so they were working on this valve, and supposedly, no way it can open. We've got mechanical interlocks, electrical interlocks, and all that. Well, somehow it opened. And it was never designed to take a full 15 pounds per square inch pressure across that huge filter. They had a big filter in it. And what happened was when that valve opened, it blew the filter out down the pipe into this phone booth where Norm Prince was exercising. It ruptured some of the liquid oxygen, but it didn't hurt him. Meanwhile, this eight-foot chamber over there, the door is slowly starting to swing closed because I'm sucking all the air out, and it's going to swing the door closed. And there's a guy in this chamber. So they managed to get that door open. So those were some of the\u2014 So there were some scary moments. Oh, yeah. Do you remember the scariest? Was that one of them? No, that was one of them. The scariest, I think, for me personally, and the reason it was scary because I could do absolutely nothing, was we had a guy in a Gemini, what we call Border Plate 2. It was a Gemini capsule type simulator. It was in a chamber at vacuum. We had a guy in there in a suit, in a Gemini suit, which had a visor which you could raise and lower, which sealed. We had him on our chest pack. And we were measuring flow. We were measuring everything. And during the run, the flow"

We had him on our chest pack. And we were measuring flow. We were measuring everything. And during the run, the flow started going down. Well, we rationalized that. The instrumentation is getting cold in there. I mean, the instrumentation is probably, it's biased a little bit towards going mumble, mumble. We rationalized our way around it. Flow kept going down. Then we got to near the end of the test. We said, well, we want to try some off-nominal, off-design cases here to see how well a COM does. So we changed some of our flow modes. and you check it and all at once in one of these things we had no flow zero flow which meant when he was breathing his carbon dioxide was was building up well we immediately we went to what we call a bypass we pressed the button and we're supposed to give him a fresh oxygen flush the problem is as we found out later we had uh mary talked about the ejector before well the throat of that ejector had frozen solid and the little uh the primary nozzle tip had also frozen over and our bypass flow came in guess what upstream of that not downstream so our bypass flow was totally blocked also so we started diving the uh chamber uh to sea level and he's screaming i can't breathe i can't breathe and he starts to open his face plate of course there's no air out there yet we screaming at him don't i'm screaming at the screen screaming at him you know totally helpless yeah we finally got him down but he was his co2 was peaked off the off the charts what happened at sky lab when you figured out how to recharge the cooling loop this is a setup you're setting me up okay we had a leak in the sky lab coolant couldn't find it so he said well we'll come up with a coolant loop recharge kit so they came up and it was like similar to an air conditioning or a repair kit you put what's called a saddle valve over the line and then you seal it and then you pierce it and then you can flow stuff into it so he came up with a cool so i had a brilliant idea aha wait a minute what if the coolant loop recharge fixture leaks so we need a coolant loop recharge fixture leakage tester so I came up with that and somebody wise guy asked what if your leakage tester leaks so we sent this kit up there put the put it on first of course the first thing to do is you try your coolant loop resurface kit leakage and it indicated a leak in the coolant loop we said well what are you going to do we're going to have to gamble that it is a leakage test fixture that's leaking so we went ahead and serviced the coolant loop never did find the leak but the coolant loop was well serviced and i end up getting an award for the coolant loop recharge kit my one contribution was the test yeah that's great all awards are not necessarily earned well that's you know that that's okay too it's still an award uh i understand you made a difference in the shuttle EMU program when you used your chemical engineering background? That's right. I knew this. This is a logical follow-on to that. This is a lesson not learned about listening to me. We had a problem with the sublimator was being poisoned. So we finally, Hamilton finally determined that the poison was a little chemical called abiotic acid and it was present in like parts per billion but it was ruining the the uh the way that the porous plate worked and had the ice bond and all that and the problem was it was coming from the water bladder material that we had it was leaching out this abiotic acid so we tried changing lots we tried and we still had it so then chemical engineering to the rescue what we need is an ion exchange bed. Good chemical engineers. They said, well, no, we don't want that. Yes, you need an ion exchange bed. Design an ion exchange bed. I forced it. This is it. Four years of college finally being used, you know, 30 years into my career. So they built an ion exchange bed. And it worked great for this one lot of material. It came in with another bladder from a different lot. It was worse. Worse with the ion exchange bed. So it turned out the on-exchange bed died. However, they had to put the on-exchange bed in a little pocket on the thermal cover. That pocket got used later for batteries for the heated gloves. So I did actually contribute. What is your greatest accomplishment in your mind of contributing to the suits or the life support? I think just, I think managing to get out of the way of people that were doing stuff, of people that worked for me. I think getting them what they needed to do the job, maybe that's what I'm proud of. Proudest of people like Alan Flint and people like that that worked for me for a while and went on to greater things. Yeah, that's, I guess just dealing with some of the people that I've met and dealt with. It's been an honor just to work with some of these people, to watch them at work. It's unbelievable. I didn't know there were people like that, just being able to see their minds work and, like I say, steal freely from them. I've learned all kinds of things, and I've watched them learn, too. We had a division chief, Ed Smiley. He came from Douglas. Brilliant technical guy, brilliant. Came in to be our section head, and he ended up being our division chief. One time, NASA was going to have a riff. So all the division chiefs got the order. You will rank your people, top 5%, bottom 5%, and you will identify the bottom 5% by name that we can fire. Oh. Ed got his branch chiefs together. they agonized over this and they finally came up with the names of the people that they could let go so they have the big meeting and Ed goes over with his list to the big meeting luckily he's not first the first division chief who had been a division chief for many years had seen all this before he got up there and he ranted and raved about the workload that they had, that not only could he not let anybody go, but he needed six more people in order to do his job. But really pressed, he could make do with what he had. And that was the tenor of all these guys. And all at once, Ed realized, I'm a tuna swimming with the sharks. That's great. That's great. It ended up that that rift didn't happen, but I mean he learned a valuable lesson. Well,"

It ended up that that rift didn't happen, but I mean he learned a valuable lesson. Well, you know, your passion is still so obvious. Does it ever stop? I mean, do you still just love it and marvel at it? I used to be in the Murr when we did the spacewalk, especially in an early shuttle, and it was agony to me. From the time that they would start checkout until the time they went out until the time they got back, it was just agony. And after we had returned to flight, after Challenger, we had returned to flight, we had a new crop of people. And these people had never seen failure. You know, in the early days of shuttle, in particular, we couldn't buy a test success. We couldn't. It was the battery would crap out. the lithium hydroxide canister would break through, the water pressure regulator would start oscillating. Back to the drawing board. We'd have failures at the plant. They'd flood the unit, push corrosive lithium hydroxide through it. We'd be down until they'd get the unit done. It was just agony. When you finally got a test that went off, God, you'd crawl over broken glass. And here was this crop of people coming in, and now the system worked, and this was the first EVA we'd elected for SDS 37, first EVA after the Challenger. And there I was, just nervous as I could be. And these guys were sitting around laughing and talking. It just irritated me no end because the danger is arrogance. The danger is hubris. That somehow success is owed. If you're a nice enough guy, if you work hard enough, on it. Success, if you ever get it, it's earned through agony. And that's what worries me about when you're really savvy with the technology and you think that's really, if I'm savvy with the technology, that's really going to save me. We had all the technology in the world and we got to where we were fit checking every piece together that would go on board space station. Why? The drawings all show it's going to work. Five words I heard from one of the best managers I ever had. Don't tell me, show me. You can tell them all day from the drawings. Show me. Put it together. Fit it together. So that's what we did. We spent, and people may be still doing it, these fit check matrices. It's agonizing. And some stuff you can't fit check. Some stuff is already up there on orbit. You're building stuff to interface with it. So you got some risk there. What was the camaraderie like when you were all working with those problems so closely together? The bigger the problem, the better the camaraderie. The Apollo 13 thing, I mean, you couldn't tell badges. You couldn't tell who was working for who. The Skylab emergency, 14 days of just going around the clock. I remember Charlie Lutz, Glenn Lutz's father was there and one night he walked out the back door of building 7A and collapsed. He had been going, going, going and his body just finally shut down. But I mean it was, you couldn't tell who worked for who. The times when it gets bad is when you essentially have too many people for the work because if you have a lot of high achievers, a lot of dedicated people, a lot of technically savvy people, they're going to find something to do. It may be in your backyard and you don't want them there so you have a lot of sandbox stuff. What you need is people so overworked in their own area they couldn't care less about what's going on next door. Where you have the problem is when you have too many people for the work to do. Do you think there's still that same camaraderie? I think it's in pockets here and there. If they're smart, they won't let on. One of the worst things you can do is let on you're having fun. When I was in the Army, I got sent out one day on a detail to mow the grass. I went out and mowed it and came back and started to say, well, how'd you like that? I said, it was great, Sarge. Next day I was mopping floors inside the orderly. So sometimes you need not to let them know you're having fun. Great. What advice would you give to someone just starting out in the industry? What tools have you honed that have been particularly important for you? The most important word I ever heard was margin. Put margin in your design. Put margin in your budgets. Put margin in your schedules. That's rule number one. Rule number two, don't let anybody know it's there. We live in the margin. We live in the margin. Right now, we got a shuttle EMU that was originally designed, the hard goods, for 15 years. That was up in 1992. How can we be still going with that stuff? Because Hamilton was smarter than I was. They put in a lot of margin. If I'd have known it was there, I'd have made them take it out. and counted myself. What a good boy am I? That's why we can go, on a seven-hour system, we can routinely go eight and a half hours. Why? Because there's margin in the design. What is the greatest lesson learned that you can share with spacesuit engineers today? There's several lessons. One is, like I said, make sure that you have margin in what you do because typically you don't know what you want when you start out. You say what you want, What you end up wanting is not what you start out wanting. And so you've got to have flexibility. You've got to be able to, without starting over with a clean sheet of paper, you've got to be able to accommodate change. The other thing is to be able to focus. I think it's probably harder now than it ever was in my day to really focus, to get time to where you can get your brain around a problem and exercise it over a period of time without interruption because that's what happens. It's constant meetings. It's constant emails. It's changes. It's this and that. If you don't have that time to be able, it's some part of your day to be able to focus and get your arms around a problem. And for me, pictures, visualizations, charts were"

If you don't have that time to be able, it's some part of your day to be able to focus and get your arms around a problem. And for me, pictures, visualizations, charts were always helpful. I guess I'm an abstract person, I had to see it. I couldn't just sit there and talk about something. And using things like flow charts, starting out with where you want to be and what are all the steps you need to get there. And again, that takes time and concentration. What I learned in, we sit around the brown table over in Building 7 and we have a problem. And you have all these knowledgeable people sitting around the table. and then one person would state the problem and an idea on it another person would restate it and you go around the table and you get around that person again and you've gotten really nowhere so i got in the habit of just getting up to the to the board and saying okay where we want to be what so we start all at once everybody's attention is focused on me so i just ask questions and i got all this talent giving me the answer all i'm doing is describing facilitating facilitating i'm not I'm not maybe contributing one iota of intelligence to it, but still somehow we come up with an answer. Great. It's like if you're ever on a jury. I told you the problem was going to get me shut up. No, we love it. We love it. If you're ever on a jury, people hesitate to be foreman of a jury. When I was on one, it was a criminal case. Anybody want to be foreman? No, nobody. If you don't mind, I'll go ahead and take it. Control. You want to be able to control things. If you're in a meeting and nobody's taking minutes, take minutes. Write actions down. Everybody's going to say, I don't remember that from the meeting. Oh, yeah, didn't you remember that? Somebody got an action. If you control that, you control part of your destiny. That's the thing. If you leave it up for grabs. You want to say that again? That was a very important sentence. What's that? About you create your own destiny by. I don't say you create it, but you can influence it by grabbing control. Sometimes you're sitting in a room and you really think you don't know more than anybody else. Maybe you don't. But if you grab the reins, take over the meeting, subtly but firmly, then all at once people start following you. You're a de facto leader. Most terrifying thing ever happened to me. First time it was terrifying. After that I got used to it. You're sitting in a meeting with all these people and this topic comes up, has to do with spacesuits or whatever your area is, and you realize, I'm the most knowledgeable person in the room on this topic. That's number one. Number two is, I don't know squat, but I know more than everybody else. That's terrifying the first time, but you've got to learn to live with that. That makes you the expert. You know, 10% more than... That makes you the expert. Yeah. like an expert, but then you reach down and if it's there, you find it and bring it up and use it. Great. Okay, here's a question from the audience. This says, can you talk about how the technical requirements evolved for the EMU and perhaps the Apollo suits? How did they all get started and how did they evolve? Well, we started everything from Air Force sizing standards. That was for the size of the Air Force standards of the 1950s. In Apollo, all the suits were custom made. They would make a full body cast of the astronauts. I walked in one time when they were doing Mike Collins. And in fact, they used a plaster of Paris. And if you didn't put enough water on it, it would start to heat. So he was telling them where it was getting hot. Under his arm and all. He was holding on to a bar. And then they were putting the plaster of Paris. Now, it turns out that other people could wear those suits if you were close enough to the size, but they were zippered entries and all that. In shuttle, we wanted something different. We wanted to be able to accommodate. At first, at the time, we had 79 astronauts. We wanted to be able to accommodate all 79 astronauts. That meant five sizes of hard upper torsos and many sizes of arms and legs and pieces like that. That was going to be prohibitively expensive. so after that we settled down what we call the the cadre concept we'd have a cadre of 20 people that would do uh eva and that way we could restrict the amount of hardware we had to buy sounded good except the cadre started floating so it was 20 names all right but they weren't always the same 20 names so we ended up you needed five sides five sides of a heart upper torso again And again, this was a constant battle between economics and wanting to fit everybody. Then you had the political aspect of it also. Most of the smaller people were women. In fact, we had like the extra small hut. It turns out maybe you want larger, strong people out there. And we had some women that were not dainty Betty Beans. They were definitely equal to the task. That's interesting. I never would have thought of that. Okay, this is our last question. It's a multi-question question. It says, EMU CO2 sensors sometimes get wet. Do you have any guidance about what to measure in a spacesuit, what not to measure in a spacesuit, where to locate sensors, what kind of sensors to use, and how to use sensor data? I'll do it once and one at a time if you'd like. Let's do them one at a time. EMU CO2 sensors sometimes get wet. Do you have any guidance about what to measure in a space suit? Well, CO2 is an insidious thing. One of the first things to go is your judgment. So trying to sense CO2 by how do I feel has some inherent risk in it. You can sense high CO2 usually when it gets so high that it's a bad time. time I was I worked in Chicago for a company that that made CO2 and I was back in what we called the lab which was a huge high roof building but it had concrete block walls about eight or ten ten feet tall and this guy in there who happened to be six foot eight he was he had a CO2 tank a liquid CO2"

Then it got to be, even when I was standing up, I couldn't breathe. Then I realized what happened. I was drowning in CO2. He was 6'8\", so it wasn't bothering him. I was 5'9\". So CO2 is a bad one. CO2 sensors get wet, and I don't know what the problem was that they had on this recent EVA. Maybe it was getting wet or not. They put measures in place to try and keep them from getting wet. I know it's more of a problem on the ground, I think, than it is in flight. But what you really like, as far as instrumentation goes, is if I get a reading that I don't like, I've got some way to verify that it's a good reading. So you want to have enough instrumentation. If you can do that, if you can afford it, have enough instrumentation. instrumentation itself can be faulty but uh your first inclination is i'll believe my my instrumentation and you'd like to have some other way i can back that up okay so what not to measure in a space suit well anything here's the thing what are you going to do with the measurements As we go farther and farther from Earth, you know, if it's for the person, it becomes more and more incumbent on the person themselves to take care of themselves. The ground, especially if we go to Mars, by the time you get a ground message, the message to the ground, analyze it, get something back up to the guys, if it's been an emergency, he's either fixing himself or he or she is gone. So the things that you need to measure, first of all, are for safety. The other stuff is nice for engineering information, for trends, for calculating things, for gathering data for future missions. But first and foremost is that you want to know what it is that I have to know to keep safe. The other stuff is nice. We went a long time without the RTDS, the real-time data system. We got that in. It helped us. Keep track of things and all that. It's nice to keep the engineers busy. Engineers will want to stay busy. They like details. They like data. And in an ops situation, this is one of the things that separates people who can do ops from people who really can't. The operations world demands that you make decisions many times on insufficient data. In fact, I'd say 90% of the time, as far as what you would like to have to really make this decision, to go or not to go, to stay or not to stay, whatever it is, you need data. I had one guy that worked for me that I put him in an op situation. He could not function. He never had enough data, could not make a decision. So it takes a certain type of person to be able to say, okay, this is all I'm going to get. I'm going to go from here. Okay. All right. Where to locate sensors? what kind of sensors to use, and what do you do with the sensor data? Well, like I say, first is safety. You locate your sensor as close to what you want to measure as possible. Our first CO2 sensor that we had was an electrochemical sensor. The test for that sensor, where it was good, was a certain response, and you gave it a blast of pure CO2. you'd get 67% of the way there in a certain time. So that was how you tested a sensor. We kept that same test all the way into a unit, and it was a timed thing. So then we put a blast of CO2 in the unit, time to get to that sensor. And many sensors would still pass. and then ones that wouldn't, we'd throw out. Those sensors were probably still good. We were not measuring where we were putting it in. So we were keeping the same requirements at the system level that we had at the component level. So we were not measuring. So you want to measure as close to what you want to find out as possible. You want rugged sensors. You want sensors that are hopefully impervious to moisture. You're always going to have moisture in the suit loop anyway. I don't know, it becomes a battle of what's reliable and what's rugged and long-lasting versus what can you afford. Great. Okay, I have one last question. I want to know how you think your life would have differed, changed, had you gone into the Peace Corps. I think I wouldn't have lasted. I think the person I was then, I lacked a measure of self-confidence and self-esteem that I think would have been necessary to be able to function in essentially an alien environment and having to show leadership and thinking on my feet and all that. I think I've come a long way in that direction. I'm not sure that being put into the fire that quickly I would have been able to really contribute. So I think it's probably fortunate for me anyway that it turned out the way it did. And getting into spacesuits, being able to test the stuff I was responsible for, not working on rocket engines or something that's so big you're never going to be able to see more than a piece of it, but the spacesuits and them being so closely tied to humans and physiology and all that has really been something that I really, really enjoy. And the ability to attest to it, very selfish motive, but I really, really did enjoy that part of the job, and I would have still kept doing it if I hadn't gotten the bins several times and had to wash out of the test set of the business.

Well, surviving. the men in my family don't live past much past 70 my father died at 62 my brother died at 59 i'm 73 so i'm every day is a gift so i guess just uh what what feels good is when maybe after i gave give one of these classes or something or someone comes comes up up to me in fact it happened last last time I was here. A guy came up to me and he said, you know, you told us about for STS-79, you made them take the enhanced arms. Even though we weren't planning an EVA, you made them go all the way through the system and down the cave. He said, I remember that. So that means something. What I did was I told him I wanted to path find this thing. And I wanted to do it before we had to have it. So if something happened, we could always fall back. So to path find it and it turned out we found we had a huge leakage measurement problem that we wouldn't have found out until we waited to a mission where we had to have so that was a question of margin giving myself margin great so having him come back and say hey i used what you told me that was a great thing good well i could go on all day it's so fascinating thank you okay Thank you."

He has a long history of spacesuit knowledge that starts back, all the way back to 1958. Jim graduated with his bachelor's in geology at the University of Dayton in Ohio. And then later on in his career, he went on to get his master's of business administration at the University of Houston, Clare Lake, locally. I have that degree, too. Very good. It's a good degree. Yeah. And he went on to be here with us with the spacesuits. but it comes from the early beginnings. When he was actually in school, he actually got to be a spacesuit test subject at the Langley, at the Air Force Base there in Langley near where he was going to school, and he got to test some of the very, very early pressurized spacesuits. Jim told me even he was one of the very first engineers to test some of the CO2 removal systems that we use on the shuttle in the test that took them to pressurize systems back then. So a lot of developmental work that Jim's been involved with over his years and career. So he came to work with NASA after he graduated and he started with the Space Pass Group there at Langley and went on to really focus on the spacesuits and come here to JSC. He worked every program that we've ever had related to the space, to NASA really. He started out with Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz. He worked Skylab, he worked the shuttle program, and he worked Space Station. So we are definitely in the presence of a spacesuit legacy here today. And then he went on even, he worked for NASA for 38 years. He had multiple different roles, but he also was the branch chief there in EC-5, the spacesuit branch. And then after he retired, after 38 years with NASA working spacesuits, he went on to work with ILC Dover and worked with them for three more years. And then once he retired again, he set up his own consulting company, McBaron Consulting, and we have the privilege of being able to have him come in and lecture to us. And if you haven't had the opportunity, we did an interview with Jim. We have that recorded as well with Rebecca Wright, our JSC coordinator, and that recording will end up in the oral history project as well. So and we also have some additional topics that Jim's going to come and talk to us. But in my opinion, you're never going to be in the presence of such a wonderful spacesuit legacy and with that can you give me a warm welcome for Jim McMahan. Thank you all very much. In addition, Cinda, I worked on constellation suit program which you probably may not have been aware of as on the assessment team that for SAIC out of Langley so unfortunately it got canceled But anyway, for over 50 years now, time has passed by, and as Cindy mentioned, I started working on the Mercury program when I was a college student at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. It's sort of like a co-op, the University of Dayton, that provided test subjects and technician support for Air Force activities. And one of the projects I worked on was Project Mercury and I'll get into that during the presentation. On the first chart, you will see sort of an outline of the first phase that I want to discuss with you today, primarily addressing how the suits were selected, the suit was selected for the Mercury program. The development activities including certain development events and tests that were conducted and development of the specification as it was called back then, requirements document for the program. The second phase I'll get into will address qualification of the suit and mission support modifications that were found necessary by the mission needs. And finally, with a little bit on the MA-10 canceled program, which was started as an advanced development activity during the program. So on the first chart, the beginning of the Mercury suit program started in January of 59 when there was a conference called by NASA of 40 some different altitude suit experts. I've tried to identify who these people were because I'm not surprised there's 40, but I suspect they were Air Force and Navy specialists in aviation physiology, contractor people who had worked on suits for BF Goodrich and David Clark and ILC and several others, to establish a recommendation out of this group to conduct an extensive suit evaluation program with the existing known suits manufacturers and since they produced at that time and these were David Clark out of Worcester Mass, BF Goodrich out of Akron Ohio and International ATEX out of Dover Delaware. During this activity NASA requested the Air Force and Navy support to conduct evaluations of these suits which were conducted at the Aeromed Lab in Dayton where I worked and got my start in this program and at the Navy Air Crew Equipment Laboratory in Philadelphia. During this evaluation three suits were involved at Wright-Patt and I participated as a test subject part-time and mostly as a data recorder and test technician running some of the unmanned tests. There were some ten different types of activity tests performed at Wright-Patt which included static tests such as leakage, proof pressure, the term they used then back pressure which we refer to as pressure drop now. Altitude test up to a hundred thousand feet equivalent, a pulse oven thermal test, test on a centrifuge, test in a cold chamber, a long duration 24-hour test in a chamber at the equivalent pressure altitude of the mercury capsule which was 5 psia. And during all these tests, The three suits were subjected to them equally, and both the David Clark and the BF Goodrich suit, which was the Mark IV, performed very similarly. The only problem with the Clark suit was it didn't meet NASA needs as far as the helmet configuration. It was not a spherical visor, but an X-15 type helmet with a mechanical visor closure. And the Navy suit, Mark IV, had a spherical helmet, but it required an auxiliary high-pressure source of gas to seal the visor when it was in a closed position, which was not in a NASA requirement as well. In addition, the Navy suit had a poor ventilation system, which was found unacceptable during the Pulse 7 test. and this was significant in that at the time there was concern that during reentry the suit would be required to provide thermal protection to the crew member due to the increase in temperature in the cabin of the capsule. Similar tests were conducted at the Naval Air Crew Equipment Lab and as a result there became a second conference in July of that year and both Clark and the Goodrich suits, as I mentioned, were ranked equal, about equal, by both the Air Force and the Navy who conducted a test. Now, I'm not too familiar with what tests the Navy conducted because I wasn't privileged with that information at the time and have been unable to find that data so far. I'm still looking, however. As a result of that conference, it was determined that NASA wanted both the Air Force the Navy to do some additional development work, in particular work on the ventilation system problem in the Navy suit and to use different combination of suit features and parts in that activity. And NASA's concern at the time was the compatibility with the Mercury capsule and the ECS integration requirements. Thermal evaluation testing was done at Wright-Patt"

And NASA's concern at the time was the compatibility with the Mercury capsule and the ECS integration requirements. Thermal evaluation testing was done at Wright-Patt with modified suits, which included 24-hour manned chamber tests to check mobility and fitting, 180-degree F-man thermal test in a temperature for two hours, that was Thermal Pulse 7, 8G equivalent on the centrifuge, and also some acoustic tests to test the sound attenuation characteristics of the helmet so that the crew member would be protected during the launch environment where it was thought to be noisy from both the Redstone and Atlas rocket vehicles. In addition, suits were taken with Donald aircraft where the Mercury capsule was designed and developed and built, which involved capsule crew compartment compatibility test. NASA's criteria as shown here were the mobility of the suit inside the vehicle be able to reach all the controls and displays compactness because the inside of vehicle was relatively small and there was not much room reliability of the parts so that if it was required to be used in the event of a decompression of the capsule at any time you know it would work and provide safety and to the crew member all the way down through landing in the the ocean, resistance to the temperature during reentry, which I had mentioned, pressure integrity in the event of loss of cabin pressure in a vehicle, in a spacecraft, and how easy was it to don the spacecraft, I mean the suit, in the suit room in hangar seven at the Cape, as well as doffing the suit in the event of a need for an emergency crew egress after post-landing in the ocean. As a result of all these factors and the tests that I described, BFGoodrich suit was selected by NASA and a contract was awarded to BFGoodrich by the Navy back in July of 59. These show the different suits that were in that evaluation. Whoops, wrong button. The suit here is the selected suit, a Mercury Mark IV. You can see that it has tight laced arms and legs for compactness at the time. It has a vertical reentry, entry closure. It has a non-pressurizable seal closure which provided torso elongation during donning and it was just a restraint closure. Of course the gloves with no bearings in the wrist or in the neck. a pressure gauge on the leg and on the upper torso there was a biomedical patch for readout of EKG and heart rate. The boots were separately donned and that was sort of the suit. The helmet, you can see the outlet here of the exhaust gas from the ECS on the helmet and the high pressure oxygen line coming out this side of the helmet were attached for a high pressure gas source for pressurizing the helmet visor when it was in the closed position. This particular suit is a David Clark suit and obviously if you're a suit person you recognize that it's made of link mat which provides a restraint for the bladder on the inside. It contained here again an outlet fitting, an inlet fitting here. The helmet was an X-15 type MC2 helmet and here was a latex suit. similar as to what you think about looking at a suit for Apollo. It had convolutes and bellows with cable attachments for the bellows and separate boots and and a helmet they had worked on. This is sort of some of the differences between the Navy Mark IV suit and what was required for the Mercury suit. The Navy suit was a had two compartments so to speak and a separate compartment in the helmet with a face seal in which in a normal aircraft vehicle oxygen was supplied from the vehicle which had then exited out of the helmet down into the torso or lower compartment. The lower compartment was connected to an aircraft compression compressor system that provided ventilation when the suit was in operation. Now in the Mercury suit it was a full pressure suit with a single gas enclosure both helmet and torso with the oxygen inlet as I mentioned and shown as on a place on the on the torso and an outlet on the helmet. Exhaust gases exited the helmet at the helmet and the cabin ECS oxygen supply was critical in that it limited the amount of maximum leakage that was allowed in the suit because of the amount of oxygen carried on board the spacecraft. Pressure drop from inlet to outlet of the suit was considered significant because it had an impact on a vehicle ECS system power which with a higher pressure drop you lose power and in their limited amount in the vehicle required a low suit pressure drop. This is a contract that the Navy received from NASA to develop and provide the suits for Mercury. Now this was sort of a little unusual and I think one of the reasons why the Navy Mark IV suit was selected is that the Navy was in production of the Mark IV suit for their military needs and could add on some added work for the NASA on the NASA suits. So the Navy on a Navy contract with Goodrich, 21 suits plus spare parts kits were to be provided. And the first suits were made for Wally Schirra, of course an astronaut. Dr. Douglas, let me get back here, who was a flight surgeon for Mercury and Gilbert and and Warren Norris, two brothers who were very much pilots and interested in making sure that the suit that was provided worked properly, both from an aircraft viewpoint, McDonnell Douglas, and from NASA headquarters. In addition, nine additional suits for engineers and astronauts were to be provided, which ended up being the prototype and training suits. There were eight final configuration suits, one pre-production qual suit, and seven suits for flight. Estimated cost of that contract at that time was $75,000 for all those suits. That just seems unreal, doesn't it, today? Was that to process the contract? That was the contract to finish development, qualify, and manufacture 21 suits and providing spare parts kits. It did not include field support, which was picked up on a direct NASA contract with me a few minutes later. Cost did go up, however. and you'll see that in a minute. There were additional development tests conducted in 59, in particular additional thermal evaluation of the modifications of the Mark IV suit to improve their ventilation system, which was found to be lacking in the original evaluations, and that's the tests that were run. Also, there were additional tests at McDonnell Douglas to evaluate the crew quarter aspect with the crew displays and all the equipment inside the small spacecraft that Mercury was, you know, at the time. And also operational evaluation connected at Space Task Group, which was in the first suit lab that NASA had there that I was put in charge of when I got the job working for NASA. At that time, the suit design issues were fabric stretching due to the thermal environment, user discomfort, which was related to the ventilation system, and the tightness of"

And also operational evaluation connected at Space Task Group, which was in the first suit lab that NASA had there that I was put in charge of when I got the job working for NASA. At that time, the suit design issues were fabric stretching due to the thermal environment, user discomfort, which was related to the ventilation system, and the tightness of the Mark IV suit, which required redesign of some of the joints and the torso, and poor gas circulation that still existed. The to be center director Bob Gilruth sent a letter to the chief of the Naval Air Equipment Lab providing the data that was expected by NASA to be met from the Big Joe reentry test and ECS testing of the suit thermal performance and identified which I'll show you in a subsequent identified development of programs to be pursued by the Navy with BF Goodrich, to solve suit materials problems to prevent the stretching after heat testing and wear that I mentioned, to finalize the suit heat protection or the ventilation system and ventilation configuration, improve the compatibility with the Merzinger capsule, which meant additional unpressurized mobility, exhaustive qualification testing that NASA expected to be done, and to develop an in-suit urine collection system that would work in zero gravity. And the in-suit ventilation system that I've mentioned several times there with emphasis on improving ventilation. That was the primary significant driver in the suit development for Mercury was providing adequate ventilation that was compatible with the Mercury Environmental Control System. I'll get into the specs on that a little bit later. Now the enclosures that were provided with that letter, the first one was the results of the little Joe test which showed, getting used to this thing, the as altitude during re-entry of the capsule, the suit ventilation loop in the ECS system reached a point during re-entry went from about 70 degrees normal gas temperature up to over 105 degrees for the rest of the mission from landing all the way through the one hour post landing period. This shows the cabin wall temperature during reentry and the cabin wall gas temperature and in the ECS system and the effect it had on the system being able to ventilate the suit loop. So that was sort of the significant driver for the design of the ventilation system. In addition, the enclosure provided the schedule that NASA expected to be met. And you can see that from February to March through April, NASA expected a lot of work to be done on a very short schedule to meet the schedule requirements. And that included the completion of the development suits for these people, the pre-production suit. Now This was, in our terms, a qual suit and a production of flight suits. This is a picture of the suit with Deke Slayton in it, if you recognize Deke, which was the first true prototype Mercury suit. You can see the helmet with the exhaust fitting here. A high-pressure oxygen source here to inflate. When you pull the visor down, you had to have the visor down for the seal to inflate. There's a little valve here on the side of the helmet that locked the visor down in place with the high-pressure oxygen. The suit entry, pressure-sealing slide fastener, helmet tie-down with pulley down to the crotch, zippered glove disconnects, a non-bearing disconnect at the helmet, and separate Daner boots coated white for the thermal protection. There were segmented shoulders for mobility to eliminate some of the problems of the tightness and suit stretch that was developed. Straps were added under the arms to keep the shoulder ballooning to a minimum when the suit was pressurized. As a result of the testing on Little Joe, they found that it was no longer necessary to add a sponge insulation layer between the outer cover layer and the restraint layer. And the crewmen wanted curved finger gloves, except for the middle finger. They wanted straight so they could impact the displays and control switches inside the capsule. And they wanted more tactility feel on the fingertip ends with a roughened texture so they could actually feel the switches and controls that were in the capsule when the suit was pressurized. To make the suits fit good, these suits were all custom sized, they actually took brown paper and paper mached the complete body form of each of the seven Mercury astronauts from which was made the patterns for each of the crew member suits. I mentioned they had additional cost for all of this, it ended up being $100,000, over 100% more than the original estimate. Now the specification at that time for the SIDS system, it had to meet an operational temperature range, minus 65 to 180, and that was sort of strange at the time because the The vehicle would never see that extreme, but that was a Navy specification residual item from their military needs. The suit pressure was normal pressure in vent mode was.15 and 5 psi was the capsule pressure that was normal. And in the event of loss of cabin pressure, which was at 5 during decompression, it went to 5 psi G in a suit. Maximum leakage that was allowed was 200 cc per minute with a pressure drop, they call it then back pressure, four and a half inches of water at a flow rate through the ECS of ten and a half CFM. The suits were custom made at the factory and sized there. Maximum weight was 30 pounds and compatible with all ECS controls and displays. These were sort of the major system designers, and these were the components that were part of that contract. of course the helmet, torso gloves, and in order to provide adequate ventilation there was a ventilation set of underwear that I'll show you in a minute that had patches of tri-lock in the upper thigh area and on the back thigh area and on the back of the crew member's back so that during laying in a capsule, like at 1G prior to launch for several hours, you had adequate ventilation through the suit. This was to help the ventilation. This was the prototype suit with the outlet exhaust, the inlet, with a manual closure requirement, and pressure gauge relocated on the wrist so it doesn't show there, and a biomedical patch for the attachment of the EKG and heart rate. Here you can see the pleated arm with a single restraint down the side. Likewise on the leg for the leg. These were the very specific requirements in the Navy spec that was imposed upon the requirement of the Mercury suit. They used a plexiglass visor with an open position lock, so when the visor was in the up position it was locked in place. It was a detent. A visor closed position was sealed and locked by an inflatable bladder seal, as I mentioned. The visor sealed bladder operated from 35 to 95 psi.

Here you can see the pleated arm with a single restraint down the side. Likewise on the leg for the leg. These were the very specific requirements in the Navy spec that was imposed upon the requirement of the Mercury suit. They used a plexiglass visor with an open position lock, so when the visor was in the up position it was locked in place. It was a detent. A visor closed position was sealed and locked by an inflatable bladder seal, as I mentioned. The visor sealed bladder operated from 35 to 95 psi. It was inflated by an auxiliary oxygen source with a deflation on-off button. This auxiliary device was a very small oxygen bottle that was located in the capsule along the side of the crew member. The requirement was that the bladder seal be capable of 100 actuations by the left hand. Visor defogging completed by the ventilation flow. Visual field requirements in the helmet. Quickly pressure sealing neck ring, not a bearing, to remove the helmet from the torso. Non-crushable shock absorbing padding in the helmet. An outlet fitting of one inch diameter, operable by one hand. Max comfort for 30 hours wear and if anybody has worn a suit for any period of time, you know the fresher the ear muffs to provide adequate calm gets to really be a pressure point or hot spot in the helmet. Full head nodding at the operational pressure 5 psi. A tie down to prevent helmet lifting when the suit was pressurized and a sweat band to protect the eyes from perspiration which was part of the ventilation activity for the system. Communications was an A1C-10 which was a standard military interphone system at the time. NASA wanted the smallest microphones and earphones available that were capsule compatible. microphones independently wired each earphone individually wired on a separate circuit and a 20 year 20 DB sonitude from each ear cap this is pretty much the standard Navy Mark IV requirements the torso neck ring and torso extended to through 1 3rd the length of the forearm circumvential sizing and adjustment straps kept to a minimum no excess bolt socks fixed to the leg with multiple sizes for the boot bladder. Prevent inboard water leakage when the helmets removed which meant we needed to have a neck dam. We had a rolled up neck dam that was provided with a groove on the helmet neck ring for retention. Maximum mobility for all conditions sort of a standard for all suits. To prevent joints and disconnects prevent external gas leakage from the 200 cc's and additional internal water leakage in the event that the crew member had to evacuate the capsule and get into the ocean. One inch ID hose on the left side for the inlet from the ECS detachable with one handed operation. Entrance closure allows a minimum effort for down and doffing. Pressure gauge on the left thigh at the time which later became on the right wrist. coated at this range and 23 psi compatible so it was compatible in a launch condition in a cabin at 14 7 plus the 5 psi ECS proof test that was done on the pad and a 16 terminal bio patch with no shark or thick areas on the backside where it would be uncomfortable for the crewmen on the chest as far as gloves they extended one-third of the remainder down to the fingertips disconnect only at the arms bladder and restraint palm restraint to prevent ballooning at the wrist which was a common problem for all gloves a wrist strap to facilitate wrist bending which minimized the diameter of the wrist so bent easier and outer friction service to provide tactility The boots were to provide wear protection over the torso and to have a friction surface so that the crew member had traction when he had to evacuate the capsule on the pad through the emergency egress system. Ventilation system under the garment. That was the undergarment. Provide thermal comfort. No cold spots or hot spots with this range of conditions from the ECS system. No binding or pressure points after donning. and the contract called for three units to be provided with each suit so that they could be washed and cleaned between suit uses. That sort of summarizes the development activity up to the point of establishing a requirement. I didn't mention when I was working at Wright-Patt on the Merkler suit testing, a lot of NASA people observed and participated in the activity there. And I met Dick Johnson there, who later become our division chief. And based on that experience and his observation of my work, he hired me to work for NASA to take over the suit program for Mercury back in June of 61. So it was a fortunate activity that I participated as a college student there on that contract. Gave me the inside track for NASA at the time. Looking at the distribution of suits that were purchased, it appears that you had testing suits, but you didn't have training suits. Yeah, we did have training suits. There were eight suits that were built. I can go back to SCAR. There were 21 suits total. There were four engineering development suits. There were eight suits, one for engineer and seven for training for crew member, and an additional eight suits, one for qual and other seven for flight, 21 suits total. But there were two suits then roughly for each of the Mercury 7s. Each for two of the mercury 7. That's 14. And then the development suits and the quall suit. So any other questions while we're waiting? Also, a historical note. I understood that they had their choice of what fabric to use, the blue, the white, the silver, and the silver was as much a problem? Well, actually, the aluminized nylon was picked for thermal reasons because at the time, it was a thermal issue. And they thought the reflectivity of aluminum would help negate the heat exposure from inside the capsule walls. And that's why there was no choice of the color silver. Later in the next presentation I'm going to do for you when I talk about Gemini and the next capture series item, I'll discuss why we went to a white color Nomex for the outer restraint of the suit. Any other questions while we're waiting? I can't have covered all the bases, I wouldn't think. You surely must have a question or two. I am fortunate, I have a lot of these source materials like the original Navy spec and the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base report that was given to NASA. I have a copy of that. I have some original photographs that I got when I was working at Wright Path that you saw there, the different evaluation suits, that those photographs initially were rated confidential. And on the back of them there's a confidential declassification stamp from the Air Force. Because back in those days, the race with the Soviets was on, and we didn't want to let them know what we were doing or how we were doing it. And so. Am I right that those inflatable ladders on the wrists and neck probably saved Gus Grissom's life when he got there? I'll get into that. That's the next phase of the story here. I'm going to get into each crew member's flight. Okay. And a mod's required, and I participated in that. I actually was sent to Grand Turk Island for the crew member debriefing after his water exposure, and that was awesome. I got to fly in a C"

I'm going to get into each crew member's flight. Okay. And a mod's required, and I participated in that. I actually was sent to Grand Turk Island for the crew member debriefing after his water exposure, and that was awesome. I got to fly in a C-130 with all the center chiefs, and sat on the next seat with earplugs. And we were greeted at Grand Turk Island on a red carpet with the British guys with their white pith helmets and swords. And for the center director, that was pretty interesting debrief that I participated in. You remember, I started working for NASA. I was just 22 years old. So at that time, I was just a young whippersnapper, so to speak. And I was rubbing shoulders with all these so-called giants of the program, Dr. Gilruth and Paul Perser and Chris Kraft and Gene Kranz. And I was here with Jim McBaron, just a little peon, so to speak. I don't know where you were. OK, this is good. I can catch up here. This is the second part where I'm going to talk about the certification or operational qualification that was done. And then I'm going to get into the modifications required for each mission as based on the mission needs starting with, of course, Mercury Redstone 3 with Al Shepard, the first suborbital flight, Gus Grissom the second suborbital flight, and John Glenn's first manned orbital flight. And this sort of gives you the time period that all this happened. And here again it's from this presentation I forgot to mention earlier that was presented at the Aerospace Medical meeting by Dr. White, who was the first chief of the Crew Systems Division, Dick Johnson who took over and hired me, and Frank Samovsky who was the ECS manager for crew systems on the Mercury program. Okay, production suit qualification. There were two types of tests run on the suits based on a terminology existed in those days. There was pre-production acceptance tests that was performed on just one suit and they were performed in this order. Started with leakage, you know, much a leaky spec. Then there came environmental stress at these conditions on a single suit. Additional stress at the suit operating pressure and flows. A leak again not to exceed 200. A room temperature test at 5 psi with vent limit flow for 24 hours. No structural other defects was sort of the pass fail criteria and here again leakage at 200 at the operating pressure. That was the environmental stress test on one suit that was conducted by the Navy. Proof environmental 180 degrees here. Helmet they did it at seven and a half psi rather than the five that was done on the rest of the suit. Here they put a helmet in a test plate and did these tests. Then the requirement for acceptance was look for defects and damage and again a leakage. They allowed an increase in leakage here after this particular test because it was a very stressful test. There was suit endurance after exposure to the test I just mentioned shown on the chart. 24 hours at 100 degrees with those conditions, 4 hours at minus 40, 20 hours at 160. They repeated that three times then they pressurized the suit for three seconds for decompression for 500 cycles. Examine again for defects, leakage less than 250 again at the operating pressure. Closures endurance, that's the pressure ceiling slide fashioner primarily, 500 cycles for all gas leakage and internal wire leakage again, and leakage less than 250 that. So you can tell these are pretty significant stressful tests that the suit had to meet. In addition, the visor inflation hose to the helmet had to withstand a tension load or a pull load of 75 pounds fitting in the end and 150 pounds internal pressure in the seal with no porosity when they submerge it in water. They cycled the visor seal a thousand cycles with no leakage with the activation button in the off position, no evidence of visor seal porosity, pressure drop at sea level, less than four inches of water again which was the spec, and then they ran an altitude test in less than five inches of water, suited, manned test at 27,000 feet and a flow of 10 CFM. That's the 5 PSI equivalent. Visor defogging test was conducted with a corrective manned test with a suited subject with breathing oxygen, visor in a down position at 6 degrees F with oxygen at that flow rate, saturated, with the condition of anti-fog to be applied to meet the requirement, which was found very much necessary, and no visibility impairment due to fogging. They had an explosive decompression test from 8 to 27,005 in 0.2 seconds with a vent airflow of 100 liters per minute and examined for damage and then redo the leakage test. This was a visual field requirement levied on the helmet for vision in the line of sight with the head fixed in a normal position. In addition, the soup pressure gauge was tested. They accelerated 25 Gs in both directions along all three axes of the gauge. They drop tested at 45 Gs in both directions, three axes, with Ompac Lewis. This was a pretty significant test on the pressure gauge. Recalibrated it to 0.1 psi. Cycled it to 8 psi 15 times. recalibrate, install on the suit, subject to low pressure chamber, deviation less than 0.1 again, decompress the suit again, and recalibrate to within 0.1. So that was a pretty significant test on a pressure gauge, and that was very significant use in the suit. Also there was calibration, I guess a mercury column, they used mercury back in those days believe it or not, and with the deviation less than 0.1 again. In addition on a helmet they looked at piercing resistance of the shell, resist piercing by 16 ounce steel plumb bob dropped from a height of 4 feet at an angle of 60 degrees. Points of impact one in each of six 60 degree sections of the helmet and no more than a 1.25 protrusion at any point on the helmet. These are pretty much standard Navy tests on the Mark IV suit that NASA picked up and reimposed on the Mercury suit. Here again the leakage not to exceed that amount at the operating pressure. Now that was the testing that was conducted to certify the suit for flight. It was done all one suit only. Acceptance tests were performed in the order listed on each and every suit that was produced before it was delivered to NASA. These These include helmet static loading, 300 pounds on the helmet, pressure gauge calibration, proof environmental on each suit and helmet, and the pressure drop through each suit. In"

In addition, there was a visor inflation hose test again, visor seal cycling, 100 cycles, helmet engagement with the neck ring, final leakage, and a comm system operable when transmitting and receiving after all of this. So that was what was conducted on each and every suit before it was delivered to NASA, both for training and for flight. This is the suit configuration that was used by Al Shepard. This actually is his flight suit. This is a picture I obtained from the Smithsonian of his suit after the flight. And you can see there hasn't been too many changes that I haven't already discussed. There's the pressure gauge on the wrist. The biomed patch that was located here has been relocated to a plug on the lower leg. And this is the backside of that undergarment I referred to you for ventilation flow with the crew member laying on his back in the capsule. Socks that were worn separately came in different sizes, standard sizes, of course. This is the helmet with the visor. You can see the connection for the electrical. This is the ventilation outlet, the pressure seal that we had talked about. And on the backside, which is not shown here, is the on-off actuation switch for the visor seal mechanism. This is a glove with the tactility added to it with a with a zipper closure. So that was the baseline for MR3, which was a 15 minute, 28 second suborbital flight and that's the configuration I just talked about. And here you see Al Shepard in the capsule that doesn't show he has a whole lot of head room here and shoulder room on either side. He actually had a parachute here, you may not have been aware of, the crew member had a parachute available to him. And on the other side of him on a tray was a survival kit. So it was pretty cramped and crowded inside the capsule. Gus Grissom MR-4 took place a couple months later. In between these two parts here is the point where I came onboard NASA. I started work just before the MR-4 flight. And it was a 15 minute suborbital flight again. And as we mentioned earlier, this required an in-flight water survival where he had to egress the capsule because the hatch supposedly blew unexpectedly. I mean that's an available item that was dated with guests at the time and the engineers. It was the same configuration that Al flew. And in addition, the zipper closure disconnects on the arms were replaced with the self-dawn bearing. So we had bearing rotation on the gloves. There was a parabolic mirror added on the chest so that there was a camera, a motion picture camera, video camera located on the displays of the capsule and you could see in the back reflectance the actual displays reflected back to the camera so that people could see what was going on. In addition, the widow's peak, that's this little peak here on the top of the visor, was removed to increase the visibility of the crew member while he was laying in the couch. John Glenn, first manned orbital flight, lasted four hours, 55 seconds. It was the configuration same as four. As you see, there was just a buildup from suit to suit. He replaced the wrist buckles with a smaller size because it bothered him that the large dimension, He wanted smaller so he could bend the wrist easier with the bearing. Removed the torso vent duct disconnect that was on the inside of the torso. It was a pressure point for him. He wanted fingertip lights installed with a battery on both gloves. As a result of Gus Gussman's flight and the fact that he did not manually close the outlet fitting, the inlet fitting on the torso, which allowed water to enter the suit, which almost caused him to drown because water was taken on suit when he finally got into his life raft. We went to a self-closing disconnect. We disconnect the nozzle and automatically pop it shut the connector so that was self-sealing which prevented water closure, water entry. We replaced the Rodenwell microphones with Electro-Voice mics to provide better static free communications in a system. We added a new leakage test at the normal operating pressure 0.15 because on the pad we had a crew member, John, during one of his mission scrubs and may have been a cause of the scrub. We had excessive ECS leakage into the cabin and when we got back to the suit lab afterwards we found one of the wrist bearing seals was installed backwards which allowed an an excessive amount of oxygen to leak out of the suit. Also added a life vest on a parabolic mirror as a result of gusts of grisms experienced on MR4. Here you can see the life vest added there. He also added a mirror, which was a crew optional item. You can see the fingertip lights and the battery pack. Scott Carpenter on MA7 in May went up for four hours, 55, 66 minutes, almost five hours, and he is the same configuration as John, except that the glove bladders, we replaced the molded rubber glove bladders, which was a thick rubber, with an S-stain material, which was a BFGoodrich polyurethane material that they developed that was dipped, that had a little less thickness and provided more flexibility under pressure. And he wanted a red coloring on the left glove fingertip lights, which we provided so that in a dark pass around the earth, he had a red light inside the capsule for visual accommodation. Wally Chirot, MA-8, flew for nine hours with third orbital flight, configuration same as seven. We had a problem with Wally in this position, he put a lot of strain on this upper part of the closure, pressure ceiling side plaster, and we had several zippers that we had to replace on his suit. So we added a strain relief at the top to prevent the closure opening when he was donning the suit. There was a materials problem on the risk is connect aluminum that started corroding that we replaced with stainless steel and we replaced the electrowoist microphones with Plantronics which was a smaller size microphone inside the helmet because you can see and like inside the helmet here there's not a whole lot of room. For Gordon Cooper first full long duration flight of the Mercury one day Mercury program and the last Mercury flown flight. Same as configuration but we replaced the Plantronics microphones with noise cancelling microphones because there was some static during the MA-8 flight that the people didn't like so we put in the Plan"

Same as configuration but we replaced the Plantronics microphones with noise cancelling microphones because there was some static during the MA-8 flight that the people didn't like so we put in the Plantronics. The suit people didn't provide the microphones and earphones they were provided to us by the communications people and we just installed them and they met our requirements for attachment. We replaced the pneumatic visor seal helmet with the mechanical visor seal helmet shown here with a cam that pulled down and sealed against a urethane seal which eliminated the need for this attachment here for the high pressure oxygen hose that was used to inflate the visor seal. In addition he wanted to take get rid of the separately donned boots and he wanted integral boots which was more comfortable and looser fitting with an opening that he could do so he could have more comfort in his feet during the mission. So that was all of the flown flight activities. In addition on each each mission a crew member had his choice of a mirror which was required life vest, scissors pocket, wrist mirror, accessory pocket, another wrist mirror, all of which were provided by installing attachment loops, snaps, and velcro fasteners on a suit as required. So you may see some differences in the suits and here was a checklist that was located on a knee. So based on that you you can see differences where crew accommodations were made as needed. Lessons learned from the suit assembly, which we learned, is that we always need to do a low pressure leak check on the suit. We still do that today, I assume, based on this experience where the normal operation of the suit in the vehicle, like in Apollo, Skylab, ASTP is in event mode and you don't want any exterior leakage from the suit at that point in time. So we always add, and that's where that requirement came from that's been followed in most all programs. In the torso we had excessive bladder leakage periodically. And poor Joe Schmidt and Al Rochford, the suit techs, had to repeat re-roll and re-bonding the easy bond bladder seams and do frequent leakage tests to make sure that they were not unbonding. That was a problem with the construction technique used in the mercury suit bladder. We had to replace the pressure sitting slide fastener and I mentioned that on Wally's suit. We had to deguss it on the top end and previously we had done it on the bottom end of the slide fastener. This is a low pressure leakage thing that I talked about and then finally we had the flotation necessary was for post landing water survival we added a life preserver crew worn life preserver and a deployable neck dam that was easier to work than what had been done previously that's real important for water landing suits where you have an exposure of the crew member in a suit so that pretty much wraps up Mercury so far the next thing I want to discuss is on the helmet part, the exhaust location of the exhaust fitting on the helmet caused eye irritation due to the high flow rate 10.5 CFM and a distracting noise. You know some people ever talked like a whistling effect with that outlet right near his helmet and an ear pad and we had repeated problems with the visor seal inflation bow this was a high pressure oxygen bow 2100 psi oxygen and it's sort of like a little bomb I always thought it was just about 12 inches long and two inches in diameter with a with the silicone hose and we got rid of that by going to a mechanical visor helmet and we recognize that the visor fog had to be applied just before flight. If you did it too early it didn't work too well. Gloves of course the common problem and in all glove programs for every program is it never was adequate in terms of providing low torque, high mobility and low and good flexibility and activity. Final chart, back between John Glenn's flight, after John Glenn's flight we initiated advanced technology development with Bill Goodrich in April of 62. This was in support of the one day mercury program application because at that time there was planned to be three additional flights, MA10 through 13. MA-10 was going to be Wallace-Sharaf flying again. MA-11 was going to be Gus Grissom flying again. And MA-12 was Gordon Cooper. And 13 was not identified. So they had spacecraft identified, crew members selected for those flights, and that program was approved there in October of 61. The objectives of this development was to approve, whoops. What did I do? This is the last chart anyway, which I can address. The objectives of this development was to improve the pressurized mobility and comfort. What did I do wrong? Okay. Increase the ventilation, change the ventilation system to put the exhaust fitting away from helmet and on the torso so we have an inlet and outlet on the torso. Suit mobility we had re-patterned joints, bearings, bellows, slip neck fabric. There you see David Clark's construction slipping into the Goodrich type program. Operational reliability was to relocate the pressure sealing slide fasteners that went from through the crotch and up the back of the suit like you see it saw on the Gemini suits. Again the mechanical visor seal mechanism which actually flew on MA9 and they were looking at electrically heated helmet visor for anti-fog which never was very successful at the time due to the amount of power required and the coating that was provided by Ciarason was not very, I might use the word word sticky but did not adhere as a word, adhere to the visor very good for any period of time. And then a light attenuation visor built into the helmet for sunlight attenuation so the crew member wouldn't need to wear sunglasses. However, the NASA administrator canceled this program in June of 63. The basis was they thought it was too risky to extend the MA-9 mission duration due to the fact that MA-9, a lot of the capsule systems were starting to fail and degrade, and they thought it was too risky to try and extend that capsule system performance for additional flights. And anyway, the Gemini project was underway and they needed additional resources, and probably the main reason I think for the administrator selecting the cancellation of the one-day mercury program and as a result we take this development and redirected to support the project Gemini suit development and when I have an opportunity to brief you on a Gemini suit that is where I'm going to pick up the story of briefing and continue on so now any any questions or comments that you may have. I overwhelmed you with detail. Yes sir. I'm wondering about the red fingertip lights. Do the normal gloves normally have some of the white fingertip lights on them or something? Okay the question is on the glove fingertip"

I overwhelmed you with detail. Yes sir. I'm wondering about the red fingertip lights. Do the normal gloves normally have some of the white fingertip lights on them or something? Okay the question is on the glove fingertip lights were they normally white on the fingertips. Glove fingertip lights were added for the MA7 flight. I'm sorry MA6 and the colored on MA-7 and different crew members wore them as a crew preference item as required and most of them did pick up and use the white lights. And it was just something you could just strap on to the thing? There was a built on pocket for the battery on the back of the glove with a wire that was woven into the restraint fabric for power up to the fingertip itself and it was mounted in a little pad that was sewn in place on the fingertip with the light, the little plastic light. Any other questions? Yes sir. After a lot of the redesign of the Goodrich, the MK series suit, was there any kind of disappointment in not, say, going with the David Clark suit considering that Jim and I went forward with their design? The question was, is there any disappointment during the Mercury program, I assume, by not having selected the David Clark suit for flight. Of course, as some of you may know, the David Clark suit was selected for flight in the Gemini program. And there are reasons for that application in Gemini. One of the problems in the Merkur capsule was the lack of space for a bulky suit and Dave Clark added inflated bulk to the suit and that was one of the findings at the Wright-Patterson tests that were conducted. Whereas the Navy suit was more custom tight fitting and that was part of the problem of the pressure points and so were redesigns that took place on the arms to provide a normal seated arm operating position. But I never heard of any, you know, we should have used a David Clark suit on Mercury at the time. All the astronauts liked the Mercury suit. And I think I mentioned on one of the charts, the selection of the Mercury suit by Biff Goodrich was done by a four-person committee led by Wally Schirra, who was a Navy lieutenant at the time. So it makes you wonder, did he have any preference or bias to the use of the Mercury suit? We get to Gemini, you guess Grissom's the one who picked the one on Gemini, and he had the biggest influence on that. Any other questions? Yes, sir. Is there a history of the Mercury suits anywhere? Repeat? Is there a history written? Is there anything written? I'm not aware of any real detail on the Mercury suits. Of course, there's a book put out by Joe McMahon titled U.S. Space Suits, but had very little information on Mercury. There's a book called New Oceans, which was a story of the chronology of the Mercury program itself. which has a little bit on the suit in it, not much. There's a briefing given by NASA to the Senate that had a little bit of information on the Mercury suit, but there's no book yet. I'm working on one, as you can tell, on the whole story of the Mercury suit. I've just given you sort of an outline of the whole picture due to the time concern and the work involved in putting these starts together. But I use various different sources of information for my own personal file and memory of what happened and transpired. I actually have a copy of Joe and Al Schmidt's green book that they used to record all the data when they worked on the Mercury suits and all the tests and training and flight. I have a copy of that book which was invaluable to support, you know, what changes were made for what flight because they documented it pretty well. And then from my own knowledge and some of my own paperwork. But there's not any real good Mercury story that goes into a whole lot of detail. You've probably seen the most detailed, concise story that exists on the Mercury suit that I'm aware of. I'm still looking for data from the Navy, the ACL, on what tests they run and what the results were. I got all the airport stuff, but don't have much from the Navy. Yes, sir? The movie The Right Stuff focuses on Alan Shepard having to relieve himself in the suit. You said there was a zero-g urine collection. Was that in that suit? There was a male urine collection device developed by Biff Goodrich. It was found acceptable by several crew members, but not others. That in fact was one of my first development projects was a urine collection device for the suit. It was unsuccessful with Biff Goodrich. I got a lot of trouble with Langley procurement management people because that contract was under Langley and I was green as Irish grass back then and And Dick Johnson bailed me out, thank goodness, because I didn't know that you can't just tell the contractor go do something without providing direction within the scope of the contract or funding to add scope. I learned that in a hurry. But the actual device became a personal challenge of mine and Joe and Al Rocher's. We developed in-house a urethane heat sealable bag with a special adapter using a condom-like sleeve for attachment to the person, which was flown in all the Mercury flights and worked very well. I'm not aware of any leakage problems in flight. We had some in training. Al Rocher, the technician, keeps reminding me of how we certified that bag for flight since it was built in-house. I calculated the weight of the bag with full water, 950 cc's I believe, mounted on a simulated metal plate, simulated the lower body chest area. I calculated the length of a rope that would require to spin it around with that weight and what the rate of revolution would be. And I certified it for 10 Gs behind hanger S down at the cape out on an apron, a concrete apron, sling it around. That's how we certified that bag for flight for no leakage for structure. That was an interesting story. Was Shepard wearing that when he had his incident on the pad? Yes. when the right stuff shows that sorting out the suit and stuff, it's actually really the bad stuff. Yep. Right stuff was very, well, part of it was very dramatic and blown out of proportion of certain things because, for example, when I was a university student, University of Dayton, one of my jobs was being a student test subject, and I was subjected to all of the Mercury astronaut selection physiological tests tests that Wright-Patt run from the centrifuge, water immersion, feet water immersion, and ice water and all these tests and that's why I can't hear very well because I was in"

We were, you know I wasn't the only one there was about six of us students that were in good physical shape and had the youth of the pilots that went through all these tests and it was interesting and it was interesting to compare what we did to what the right stuff did I mean it was pretty interesting any other questions yes people in there sweating to finish those things on the washing machine because you're old. How do you clean those things up? I have a BF Goodrich. The question was, is there any specs or documents available for cleaning of the suit? And, yes, there was. The undergarment was washed in a standard washing machine that we had purchased with soap. BF Goodrich provided a document, a maintenance and repair document with the suit, which I have a copy of. I'm probably the only one around now that identified all the ins and outs of the items required to disassemble a bearing and different things that were done in the field, that they allowed to be done in the field at the time. That's the only documentation I'm aware of. And there was standard wipe down of the suit with a rag dipped in hot water and light soap solution. No special anti-sterilization technique or anything like we ended up with Skylab at all. You know, we didn't have any problems. We didn't have any mold growth or anything that you might expect from perspiration, which was evident on the, you know, the cumulonimbus sometime after a test were really sweaty wet in the undergarment. You know, they took them off and had to be washed. But the suit interior was just wiped down and no problem. That answer your question? Okay, any other questions? Okay, well I guess that concludes this particular briefing. I'll see you next if you're here for the story on Gemini, which will be sometime in December, I understand. I still got to finish making that presentation. presentation. Well thank you Jim so much for coming this afternoon and sharing your great story. Jim and I program with us. We really, really appreciate that. When I came in, my only regret is I never got to work for you before you retired. But we're working on suits now and we're very delighted to have you here. Thank you. Thank you so much. Let's give him a big hand. Thank you."

And I continue to work with them really to this day and have gotten to know a number of them pretty well. And my most fond, I don't want to say friendship, was with Neil Armstrong, who you all know just passed away. If we don't run out of time, I've got a treat at the end of this. He had supported a meeting for me in May. We were together in Atlanta, and he left me some video that he had of the lunar landing that he walked us through step by step by step. It is outstanding. If we have time, I'll show it to you, and it's in Mr. Armstrong's words. It's really pretty cool. But anyway, so the whole point of this today was this is actually a 300-slide lecture on all this medical operations project. I just took out the EVA lunar surface operations stuff, which is germane for this group. But really, this is part of a very much, much bigger presentation. As we were talking earlier, only Dr. Davis, who's our directorate chair, and myself are here. Dr. Duncan was our chief of space medicine at the time, left to go to the National Transportation Safety Board. unfortunately died in a plane crash in May that you may have heard about. Dr. J.D. Polk then took over. He was our chief and he left to become the deputy medical officer for the Department of Homeland Security. So he works for Janet Napolitano in Washington, D.C. Dr. Jones is a urologic surgeon with Baylor in the VA now. But Jeff and I together, we kind of tag-teamed Constellation back in the day and really had a lot of fun with that. Dr. Gillis is in retirement now. He was instrumental and helping us at Wiley through a lot of the background work. And Joe Novak was actually my medical student from the University of Chicago. He was also an F-15 fighter pilot, had Desert Storm experience, but also went to medical school, kind of a stud. And he helped write this as well. He's an ER physician now, captain at Wright-Patt, I'm sorry, major, at Wright-Patt Air Force Base. Well, I got back from my first deployment in 2005, and Dr. Polk at the time was the medical operations manager and said, hey, Rick, we're going to do this constellation thing. we need someone to go back and try to learn everything they can about Apollo and see what we might learn from the Apollo missions that isn't already published, it's not already out there, and so that's your job. So from December 2005 to about maybe April, May 2005, I spent 10, 12 hours a day reading everything I could get my hands on about Apollo, trying to get really, really smart on the Apollo missions from a medical standpoint. And the specific goal was really to try to identify things related to crew health and performance. I mean, if anyone's ever researched Apollo, there's tons out there on the engineering, on the technical specifications of the missions, the science. There's 600-page documents on the Apollo lunar surface science that's done, tons of stuff. But there was really a relative paucity, aside from the biomedical results of Apollo, of what impacts the crew health and performance from an operational standpoint. I'm a flight surgeon. I'm thinking operationally. How might lunar dust impact your ability to get back in the suit or different things like that? That's really kind of what we were going to. How was this operationally relevant? And it was a look towards constellation, towards the future. We were going back to the moon. We wanted to get smart on that. So we wanted to refresh our systems knowledge, validate everything that we had learned and what we were doing, and make sure that we took our current knowledge and what we knew that we were going to put into our human system integration requirements to run that past the Apollo astronauts to make sure, hey, we got this right. Because the honest truth was, I mean, the majority of us who were doing Constellation back in 2005, 2006, were like five, six years old when Apollo was doing their thing. They really didn't know much about it. And it was very humbling to go back and learn about just an amazing mission that they had done. So we want to make sure we got it right the second time around. Again, the implications were primarily for the return moon-Mars effort. And again, it was not information contained in the biomedical results of Apollo. Are there any docs here? There's no docs. Primarily all engineers. Yeah, so I'm sure none of you ever read this before. That was a very well-researched document of all the biomedical research, not biomedical, I'm sorry, biological research that were done on the polyacids, what their white counts were, what their weights were, all the different things like that. This was not that. We didn't want to republish what had already been out there. Our specific goal, again, to modify medical requirements. Again, we were starting off with the HSIR. We wanted to make sure that we were getting that right. We also want to develop a centralized database. As with a lot of things around NASA that I was finding out very quickly, stuff is everywhere. And you can waste a ton of time in your data mining trying to find information, and it was a tremendous waste of time to sit there and get this piece of information, this piece of information, whatever. So we want to make sure that if you went to Apollo Medical Operations, that you could go to one place and all your answers would be there for you. You wouldn't have to keep searching around. So that was a real key to go back and do that. and then obviously take it and try to do what I'm doing right now. I think after we did this in 2006, we published, and I forgot to bring that, we published about a 400-page document, and then I went and probably did this talk or variations thereof probably at least 67 times. I talked to EVA. I would talk to whoever. I presented this in Beijing and China in 2007. We went everywhere trying to just educate people. We weren't trying to hold our cards to ourselves. We were trying to get people interested, excited about this, and get the story right from the astronauts themselves. I basically just took what they told me, put it in publishable form, made sure that they agreed with what we were publishing, and then sent it out. So it was legitimate stuff. So I worked strategy, like I said. Went back, researched everything, got my hands on it. I'll talk about the specific documents we looked at if you want to go back and look at that yourself. Talk about how problems that they had impacted the crew, whether or not they fixed the problems, and then developed a database. and then justify having a face-to-face meeting with the Apollo astronauts. When we came up with"

Talk about how problems that they had impacted the crew, whether or not they fixed the problems, and then developed a database. and then justify having a face-to-face meeting with the Apollo astronauts. When we came up with the questions, came up with 280 questions that, to my knowledge, had never been asked before of the Apollo astronauts, we basically could justify going ahead and invite them to this meeting. It was a very interesting dynamic to go back and call Tom Stafford and talk to Gene Cernan and Buzz Aldrin and these guys and say, okay, gentlemen, this is what we're doing. would you agree to come to this? And most everyone who was able to come was able to come. And we had a great turnout for this. The first two days they wanted a closed session. We did not announce this to anybody. The media didn't know about it. No one knew about it, including the Apollo flight surgeons. And that was an interesting thing. They really wanted just the current flight surgeons and the Apollo astronauts. They didn't want anyone else in the room. So for two days at Space Center Houston, it was just us. And then the third day, we invited the Apollo flight surgeons back. and then we kind of went over a lot of different things. Then afterwards, for the five or six crew members who weren't able to attend, I went back, sent them all the results, and then we started talking, and that's where a lot of information would come out. They'd come into town for the flight physical, and then we'd spend the afternoon talking about stuff, and Buzz Aldrin did that, Ken Manningly did that, and then, of course, Mr. Armstrong. So our sources of data. The two in italics right here, it's private medical information. You can't, or not private medical information. The medical debriefs are, but the Apollo flight surgeon logs are also medical information. You can't get your hands on that. That's not available. And the BME logs. But everything else is available. So this is really what formed the basis of everything that I'm talking to you about now, all the questions. The debriefs, every time they would come back, just the same way we do now with crews, you know, they debrief with everybody. Well, we had a closed-door session with the crews, and basically for a couple days just went through everything related to medicine, medical operations, medical kits, you name it. So I went through that stuff, all the flight journey logs. The flight journey logs were actually really, really important to sit there and go through to understand the context of the mission, you know, line by line by line. And it's voluminous how much information was in there. It was really fascinating to go through like a Apollo 13's log and just see how things unfolded and how the crews reacted and what the reactions were and stuff. The really fascinating thing is, you know, all these top two documents were in this room in Building 37, and that's Dr. Polk and Dr. Taddeo, our current chief. And these documents were lost to time. They just kind of stumbled upon them one day. Oh, it's in this vault. Oh, wow, it's all the Apollo stuff. And so basically that's where I spent all my work going through all this stuff. You know, coffee stains and all. I mean, just pristine stuff. Now, this stuff you can get online. and I really highly recommend if you really want to learn about Apollo, the Apollo Lunar Surfer Journals are outstanding. Besides the fact that they go through all the missions, they've got the pictures, they've got the videos and stuff, so everything that I'm using here is publicly available for you to be able to get, but the Apollo Lunar Surfer Journals are outstanding. If you have insomnia and you can't get to sleep at night, these are a great read because they are better than Ambien. You will be out cold, but it's 700 pages of all the science in painstaking detail. And then, now this is something that I'm going to show in the next slide, but the Apollo Lecture Series was something that Dr. Joe Kerwin ran in 2005, 2006. And every month, he would invite a different Apollo astronaut, flight director, flight controller back and would just basically for two hours just let them talk about Apollo. And this is available. I'll give you the link here in a sec. But this was an outstanding lecture series that I started going to and Al Bean, Harrison Schmidt, John Aaron probably gave one of the most fascinating talks from the Apollo 12 incident and Apollo 13, et cetera. John was a great guy. And a lot of it was just personal communications. It was fascinating because once you start establishing a relationship with these guys, it goes on, and they're really, really willing to help out with this stuff. There were some other documents out there, crew personal logs, crew questionnaires, air-to-ground comm. I knew it existed, but I couldn't find it. Now the crew logs themselves, you know, a number of the crew members said they had it, but they had no idea where they had put it. It was basically their journal, their in-flight journal. And they were referenced a lot in the mission debriefs. You know, well, don't ask me that question because I already put it in the log or something like that, but I couldn't get my hands on it. So this research was not complete, but it was as thorough as I think you could get it. This right here, here's the link for this if you can see that. This is what's currently available on the recorded Apollo lecture series. So again, interested in Apollo stuff, interested in history. If you're working on new stuff, you can see some of the titles of the lectures here. You've got Aaron Cohen on guidance and controls. John Aaron, space experience. Walt Cunningham talked about Apollo versus NASA now. Something Walt's pretty animated talking about. This talk right here, Medical Challenges of the Apollo Era by Dr. Chuck Berry. Great lecture. Really worth seeing. Radiation lessons learned from Apollo. Down here is actually Apollo Medical Operations Project Briefing. That's my entire briefing. So you can go to that. And again, if you're having trouble sleeping, you can just start watching that. If you can't hear me bloviate, then you'll be out cold. But anyway, so there's a great resource here. Part of the trouble with NASA is just letting the right hand know what the left hand is doing."

So this is really good to go back to. Okay, so the categories that we came up with after we did all the research, basically were 10 categories. I highlighted just EVA, SUTE, and Lunar Surface Ops because that's all we're going to talk about today. But there's a lot of other stuff that compiled this research. I will touch a little bit on radiation and maybe a slide on environmental that I think you may be interested in. But really a lot of this stuff connects with EVA, Lunar Surface Ops. You can't disconnect them at all. but there's like i said it's it's basically a four-hour brief um probably the most interesting and memorable experience that we had was was the uh the crew psychology stuff and the crew when i sent them out the the agenda and initially i said i think apollo crew uh psychology or something like that it's like no no way you can't call it psychology so i'm like okay well what do you want to call it uh and then i sent back some ideas you know uh crew behavioral performance and then, no, I can't talk it out. So in the end, I think all we just called it was just human factors. They didn't want anything to refer to psychology. But that face-to-face time with them was fascinating because we started with questions, and then after about maybe a half an hour, they just started running the whole meeting and just started going, I didn't know Cernan did that. And they would just kind of give this stuff, and we're just writing this stuff down as fast as we could record it. And it was priceless stuff. What was their response if you had a death on orbit? Stuff like that. They just went into just tremendous detail about things like that. How was sleep affected? How were the families impacted? One of the really sobering comments that came up during one of the questions in that session, you know, had to do with, you know, how were the families impacted by your missions? And one of the crew members, and I won't reference names, but one of the crew members said, you know, I have no idea how my family was impacted. You'll have to ask my first wife. I mean, that was really sad. They sacrificed everything for Apollo. And they were very frank that NASA was not about the families back then, not the way they are. now. NASA goes all out to take care of our ISS and shuttle families, but back then, it was about NASA and that mission, and the family suffered, and it's well documented. Okay, so I came up with 655 records of all this stuff, so that gets back to that centralized database. You can see the question we asked, where we got it from, you know, what mission it pertained to, was it EVA, was it environmental, da-da-da-da, and all these records exist. Came up with basically 280 questions that the best I could ascertain had never been asked before about crew health and performance. And our initial meeting, we actually had 64% participation of the remaining Apollo astronauts that were there. This isn't a complete picture of them, but because Tom Stafford had taken off, I can't remember who else took off, but you've got Dr. Joe Kerwin, Walt Cunningham, John Young, Harrison Schmidt, Al Bean, Mike Collins, and Gene Cernan. So this just breaks down kind of the number of questions per the categories. This is just kind of housekeeping kind of stuff. You know, the majority, actually, of our questions and the response we were getting were EVA and lunar surface operations. The post-summit responses refers to the astronauts who didn't attend the face-to-face, how many actually participated and supported the question. So, you know, a lot of stuff, again, you know, bio-instrumentation, you know, isn't relevant anymore because we don't, you know, put EKG leads and biomed harness on the astronauts anymore. but we did get a lot of input because so much of their medical issues that they had during their missions were related to that stupid biomed harness. I know Dean probably remembers, but the paste that they would use on the electrodes would dry after a day or two and would become very, very irritating. And some of the crew members got these pustules, and we ended up culturing out Staph aureus bacteria from these pustules. So a lot of times the crews would just take them off. I mean, we were getting heart rate data. I think you remember back then, we didn't know a whole lot about heart rate response, temperature, respiration stuff, so we needed to know everything. We don't monitor any of that stuff now unless you're going out for EVA. And even then, we're not necessarily doing it to that depth. So anyway, some of this stuff isn't really relative. Exercise was a fascinating topic because the Apollo astronauts actually exercised. Does anyone know what the device was called they used? The Apollo Exergenie. I found one available on eBay. And it was basically just a canister with a little flywheel with two ropes that went into it, and you basically just did this. And you could adjust the resistance and just do this, and the crews loved it because it got their heart rate going, got them to sweat a little bit. The only problem was that canister got really, really hot. And does anyone know what the cabin atmosphere and pressure was in Apollo? 5 psi, 100% oxygen. So they were hyperoxic in a hypobaric environment. and the concern was primarily because of Apollo 1 that they would have a fire. So they wouldn't use it maximally because it got really hot, but they just loved using it because it got their mind off the mission and frankly the transits were relatively boring in their words. Okay, so we'll jump into comments and some of the recommendations. Again, you have to remember the glove is vastly improved over the A7LB glove, But back then, they said that was the most fatiguing part right there. They're 3.75 PSI, and they described using that glove on the moon as squeezing a tennis ball both ways for six or seven hours. So their forearms were fried when they were done. It was just really, really fatiguing. Didn't fit very well. For some reason, they said their fit was not somehow taken, anticipating what it was going to"

They're 3.75 PSI, and they described using that glove on the moon as squeezing a tennis ball both ways for six or seven hours. So their forearms were fried when they were done. It was just really, really fatiguing. Didn't fit very well. For some reason, they said their fit was not somehow taken, anticipating what it was going to be like in the moon. because, you know, in microgravity, you kind of stretch a little bit. In the moon, they were somewhere in between, but their fingertips were really, really cinched tight in the tips. So, you know, one of the most prevalent problems we have now in EVA training is the oncolysis, the fingertip trauma. They had that really bad, but, I mean, it was really nasty in there. And they said they only had about 10% of the efficiency of the human hand. The human hand has, I think, what, 28 degrees of freedom? I think that glove had like 7 or 8 degrees of freedom. So they were really limited in what they could do. and it was just very, very fatiguing to be able to do that. Another thing that was very interesting, you know, they had a silk or cotton glove liner. Not all the crew members chose to wear that. And those who did not said that by their second or third EVA that the lunar regolith, the dirt that had got in there, had abraded their proximal or the proximal interphalangeal and the metacarpophalangeal joints so badly that they were denuded and bleeding in some cases. One crew member had said that his MCPs were so swollen that if he had had to do a contingency or a fourth EVA, he couldn't get his hand in the glove. It was that bad. So anyway, one of the recommendations they definitely said is everyone should be wearing that liner and try to keep the dirt out of the gloves as much as experience. They said they had no trauma in training, although they had quite a bit of muscle fatigue, which is very interesting because as you remember from the lecture we gave a couple months ago, our biggest issue with training right now is what? Shoulder injuries, shoulder surgery. Interestingly, they didn't have that problem in the A7LB. But again, they weren't spending near the hours training that we spent in the NBL as they did back then. So, anyway, recommendation, obviously, improve glove fit. They said, you know, if you have a million bucks to fix anything in the spacesuit, spend $900,000 on a glove. Many things in the A7LB suit worked great, but definitely try to improve glove flexibility And for those who had gone back and seen our new gloves, they said that there's a vast improvement with what they had back then. One thing that they repeatedly brought up, though, if you don't have a robotic assistance for the manual labor on the moon, try to get some kind of robotic device in the glove to help actuate finger flexion extension so they don't have to be doing that. Now, one thing the Apollo guys were very loud and clear about is don't put complexity into your suit that if it breaks, you're screwed. So keep everything simple. That was the only way to put it. And they loved the idea of a lot of the stuff that was going on around 2005, 2006 when we brought them back to see the new suit design and stuff. But they said make sure that if it breaks, things are still going to be pretty functional and don't increase the complexity so much. They talked a lot about putting a wrist seal and depressurizing the glove below the suit pressure, which was interesting. So if your suit's at 3.75, make the glove at 2.5. So you're not doing the Michelin Man thing. so you have better flexibility in the glove. But again, that increases some complexity, but that also poses a problem to the tissues. When you have a differential like that, you're going to get swelling and different things. So it was a good idea, spoiled by the facts. Like I said, as much as you can have robots doing stuff on the surface, have them do it, and then wear the glove liners. And this is something that actually, we ended up having a musculoskeletal summit a year or two before this meeting, and we had a couple hand surgeons actually talking about the new glove design. And the hand surgeon and the occupational therapist know how the human hand works, and they echoed that effort. So as much as the EVA teams, the advanced suit teams, the glove teams can get the real experts in the human hand working with them to try to get to that 28 degrees of freedom, so much the better. Lower the pressure in the suit if you do that. And this is actually what we did after each day is we took them basically on a tour of the different labs to see exactly the stuff that we were doing. Actually, Dean had just finished the 10-mile walk back, was exhausted, was told he's got to help these guys and give them a couple-hour tour. And, you know, sometimes you take people on a tour, you take them through stuff, and they're like, oh, yeah, that's cool, look at that. These guys knew everything about everything, and they're just pinging people with these questions left in their mind. Poor Dean sitting there like, I just did a 10-mile walk back. But here's Jack Schmidt looking at the Mark III, Cunningham. That was very interesting, the input that they had on a lot of stuff. You may have seen a lot of these videos. That's John Young on Apollo 16. They fell a lot. And before I talked to them about falling on the moon, all I had was the videos. And I'm thinking from a biomechanical, from more of a suit mechanic standpoint, you know, how is this going to predispose him to injuries? So I'm thinking about the wrist, the elbow, the shoulder, the hip, the knee and stuff. And I'm looking at this and I'm freaking out as a sports medicine orthodontist. I'm like, whoa, man, what the heck is that about? Look at this. So I see, okay, okay. For future suit designs, because I'm thinking all kinds of stuff's going on here. You know, I'm thinking they're going to get, you know, a quad tear. They're going to rip their Achilles tendon. They're going to get a collies fracture at the wrist. Something's going to go on. So I'm getting these things all in my mind. You know, what can we do to improve the suit? And they said"

So I'm getting these things all in my mind. You know, what can we do to improve the suit? And they said, definitely, if you could reduce the suit by a factor of two, make it lighter, that would make it a lot better. No doubt about that. And you've got to remember, 1 6 G, everyone's saying, well, it's 1 6 the way. Not a big deal. But your inertial mass doesn't change. So that's the thing. If you've got momentum going, I guess it's what, KE equals 1 1\u20442 mv squared. If you've got momentum going, if you've got a mass, even though it's 1 6 G, you still have the potential to torque things, to bust things. So I'm thinking about these things. And mobility. So it's all about making the suit lighter, making it more mobile, primarily at the knee joint. One thing that they said, especially in sloped terrain, and one thing about the moon, these videos and pictures are a little deceiving. Everyone thinks the moon, who hasn't heard this, thinks it's like a desert. It's not. It's like an ocean. You've got a very undulating surface, and you're constantly going up and down stuff, not necessarily up and down craters and stuff, but you're constantly going up and down. And the A7LB didn't have a waist ring. Now, part of your normal walking emulation is the bend at the hip, some more than others. But the bottom line is if you can't do that, now you start loading the quads more and your hip flexors more, and you're going to get fatigued pretty quickly, and that's exactly what they said. By two, three hours into their EVA, their legs were burning. Their quads were really on fire. They thought it was a good workout, but they were pretty sore in front. And the same with the forearms. So if you could make the knee joint more mobile, that would be great. We learned later on that really just adding the waist ring to allow you to flex would probably unload some of the stuff going on at the knees, and that would be pretty helpful. But that was a great revelation because I thought we were going to be in a heap of hurt if we had longer lunar stays. As far as the CG, the ASIN-LB was kind of low down and aft. I mean, I'm sorry, it was kind of high and aft. And they said, you know, again, don't spend a lot of money on it. It's not your priority. But if you can, maybe, you know, make it, bring it down a little bit, bring it forward a little bit. But they were always kind of standing like that to counteract that. But they said, again, the CG wasn't a huge part. And I know Gernhardt and you guys had done a lot of work on the optimal CG on Nemo, putting different ballasts on your makeshift plis and doing different things. So I don't know where it came to that. But that certainly was something. There was room for improvement. It was adjusting that CG so they wouldn't have to be doing that very much. But, again, it wasn't onerous. It was just, you know. You sort of said that. What is interesting about that counting, and this observation and ultimate recommendation, was in the HLMB, their peripheral vision was, what they said, about 60 degrees, and you couldn't see your feet. So I throw it back to you all. Okay, go down to Galveston Beach, walk on the beach, and fall on an outstretched hand, close your eyes. The point is, you really, to fall safely, have to be able to see where your hands, your wrists, your arms are at to be able to do that in relation to your body. If you can't do that, you're going to bust a wrist. You're going to do damage to your form. And that was one of the main things that they said. You've got to improve your peripheral vision in your helmet because you can't prevent falls. And they said actually falling on the moon is actually a lot of fun. And I didn't believe it because of the videos I saw. But the week after this, I was the medical monitor for a vomit comet flight, and we were doing like 20 or 30 lunar parabolas in addition to the zero-g parabolas. And during the zero-g ones, I tried getting hurt. I would push off and really try to slam into the floor of the plane. It was fun. It was just falling in one-sixth-g really is kind of fun. And so I believe what they said, but it doesn't change the fact that you've got to be able to see where your body parts are at. And if you can't see that and you don't know what's going to go on, you're going to torque something. So really try to improve the peripheral vision if you can so you can see your feet, you can be able to turn and see what's going on. I've been in the Mark III, and I think there was a definite improvement in your peripheral vision. Seeing your feet is still hard, and you're never going to be able to do that just because you're going to have all your stuff in front of you, but at least to be able to see your hands. I'm not so sure from an injury standpoint or a biomechanical standpoint. It's huge to be able to see your feet, but you definitely have to be able to see your hands. you have to be able to see around you and see what was going on. A number of these guys were all ex-Navy fighter pilots and felt that the deep-sea diving rings in the Navy helmets would be a great addition if you could put that in there. What about HUD? We're starting to get into heads-up displays, which are really pretty darn cool. And they thought, you know, if you could get a HUD on your helmet visor, do it. That would be great. As long as its failure doesn't totally screw your mission. So you always should be able to have a backup for that. But if you could develop a HUD, what they said would be useful would primarily be navigation and suit information, not necessarily biomedical information. And that was one thing that kind of burst a bunch of the docs bubbles because we want all"

But if you could develop a HUD, what they said would be useful would primarily be navigation and suit information, not necessarily biomedical information. And that was one thing that kind of burst a bunch of the docs bubbles because we want all this medical information. But really, they're like, well, as far as heart rate monitoring, you just got to think, is my heart beating fast? Okay. Am I breathing fast? The things that are really most important to know is what's my oxygen, what's my carbon dioxide scrubbing capability, what's my water, what's my battery. Those are things, and if you don't have it on a HUD, maybe you could have it on a callback system where you could just say oxygen level, and bam, it would give you oxygen level or something like that. Those would be very useful pieces of information. Larry Kuznets, I know you know Larry Kuznets. Does anyone else know Larry Kuznets? He was a BME for Apollo and relates this story. When he went back, they didn't have the ability to do real-time consumables assessment. It was all estimates based on training. They brought that into the mission and then kind of fudged it, and then they did the calculations afterwards to find out how much actual consumables they had left. And I don't know if it was 15 or 16, Larry said that he calculated out they had about 7% oxygen left. They were like in the red zone for oxygen. They had no idea at the time. And, you know, similar to what we do with NBL, which is much higher fidelity to our missions, we know what your MET rates are. We know what your oxygen consumption is. They didn't have that back then. And they had no idea they were on the edge of the cliff. And it would have been a hard stop, which would have been catastrophic. So these things in the suit, if you could start putting robust, redundant capability in there that would allow you to be able to see this, and if you have it in a heads-up display, that would be golden. So that's pretty cool. I've given this lecture at MIT with David Newman's Aerospace Engineering Group. They've taken this, and they're really trying to develop stuff like this for their future suits. So it's really a neat effort, provided it doesn't fail. Okay, lunar boot. I asked a lot about the lunar boot because I watch those videos and think for sure they had ankle sprains, they had knee sprains, they torqued their hips and stuff like that. And this is a great shot of Harrison Schmidt doing something that they did a lot. Oh, dadgummit. Dadgummit. Jack Schmidt having a few problems. So, you know, again, as a doc, I'm thinking knee-hip ankles, lots of bad things are happening. You know, what was that, what was the foot, what was the ankle actually doing in that boot? And they said, actually, the boot was great. Never changed the A7LB boot. They said it protected the ankle. It wasn't quite like a ski boot, but it was very comfortable. You were able to do what you needed to do. The only thing that they said was that on the rocks, because the lunar rocks have a high component of silica, glass, and they could be slippery. and if you stepped on a rock, you know, inadvertently you could slip off that, then maybe you would want to have something on the bottom. But because the lunar regolith has such a high coefficient of friction, it's not like dust or snow. It actually kind of grabs you when you walk, so you're not slipping around. And the videos, the pictures you see are kind of deceiving because it looks puffy and, you know, flaky and snowy. It's not like that at all. It's these jagged, evil things that just kind of grab onto everything, including your boots. So they didn't feel like they were slipping or doing anything like that, except for rocks or boulders. If you had to step on that because of the silica, you could slip, and you had to be careful with that. This is fascinating. I thought when Mike Gurnard in his lab recreated the walking versus kangaroo hopping on the treadmill and measured their metabolic rate, it was fascinating because they confirmed something that the astronauts kind of intuitively knew, but they had no way to assess that. That was because you didn't have a waist ring and because of the mechanics of the suit, that hopping was a much more metabolically efficient way than actually trying to just walk, and that's why they did the kangaroo hop. Let's hear some Schmidt and Jean's turn on Apollo 17. Do you see that undulating terrain? Or is this a neat way to travel? Isn't that great? I like to skip along. But, hey, boy, skip. But, yeah, bottom line, again, it was just from a metabolic standpoint, it was just easier. Their quads didn't get quite as tired. However, when they were going up and down the slope terrain, the mechanics prohibited them from doing that, and then they had to try to walk, but then that was much more fatiguing to be able to do that. drink bag. They really wanted to have stuff in there that we would consider today, you know, like any of our sport drinks or something. They didn't have that back then. They had this kind of orange drink stuff. And one of the problem, one of the big issues that gets in the environmental stuff was the fact that they used a chlorine sterilization system for their water. And the chlorine came in these little ampoules. And they had to be able to break the ampoule, get into the water system, but they had no ability to really mix it. So when they activated the water gun, which frequently got stuck, put it in their mouth to take a drink, they frequently got a mouthful of chlorine. So what they ended up doing quite often was they used the tang to mix it in there and then they basically said you had orange or grape flavored chlorine. So they actually didn't drink a lot because it was so onerous to try to use that, which is fascinating. But they said the drink bags themselves were really kind of a pain to use. In fact, John Young on Apollo 16 had somehow got his in backwards or something, so he got to the start of his mission, and then he couldn't get any water. He went his entire six-hour walk in that particular EVA and didn't have anything to drink. It kind of"

He went his entire six-hour walk in that particular EVA and didn't have anything to drink. It kind of spilled all over the place. He had orange stuff all over the place. He said, you've just got to make this a simple system. I think they were 32-ounce bags, and they really wanted 64-ounce bags. They wanted a lot more water, which is interesting. Develop a better insuit UCD that'll work on 16G. Again, the waste management system by far was the bane of Apollo from a health and performance system perspective. I don't go into a lot of detail on it, but it was bad. It was so bad in terms of their waste management that if you had to defecate, the system they had was basically just in a bag. They called it the Apollo bag. and you just kind of stood up because there's no way to squat down and secure yourself. And you basically just figure out where your anus was, kind of try to aim it up and try to go in that bag. And frequently you missed and stuff was floating all over the place. So what the crews did, unbeknownst to the flight surgeons, is they took very high doses of Lamotil. Anyone know what Lamotil is? It's an antidiarrheal. What does it do? It cuts down peristalsis, so you basically constipate yourself. They intentionally constipated themselves so they didn't have to use the waste management system. It was that bad. And I had one of the crew members tell me, I still find this hard to believe, that he went his entire eight-day mission without a BM. And he said he wasn't impacted. And I said, that's impossible. But, I mean, think about it. Simple things you just don't think about could have, who knows. I mean, obviously, none of you guys probably knew that kind of stuff. But that kind of stuff, as I started going through all this stuff, the stuff's coming out, I was like, holy cow. It was fascinating because when we were, me and our fellow flight students, were literally fighting with the Orion engineers to get a toilet. They basically said, nope, the toilet that we came up with was about 48 pounds. They said, it's too heavy. You're not going to get that in your spacecraft. I'm like, okay, I'm going to give you some Ziploc bags. You go in a closet for seven days, see how you like it, see how much this is going to impact your performance. Give me a freaking break. And then trying to explain the difference between male and female anatomy and why you need an adapter for urination and stuff like this. I mean, these were the discussions that were ongoing during Constellation. But these guys kind of hit it on the head there. This is what's going to happen if you're going to start taking medications, you're going to do stuff to avoid using a very nasty system. And the UCD in particular, they said it was undersized. But they said that it didn't work well and it leaked. And they had urine leaking all over the place. and it was not a good environment. They said you could probably go to 3.5 PSI or 4.3. You could definitely go to 3.5, and they suggested just sticking with a single gas system. They never fogged, but they were always worried about that possibility. If they did fog and not being able to see anything, that would be a real big problem. But they never did fog. So I don't know right now. I don't think we've really had problems with fog because we put that surfactant kind of stuff all over or whatever. So it hasn't been a problem, but we've had problems with that surfactant getting in the eyes, so it's not without its issues. And then this was an interesting idea. Obviously, the number one thing you're always thinking about on the moon was puncturing that suit. We never had a suit puncturing on the moon, but obviously there was jagged edges and stuff and whatnot and puncturing the suit. And they thought something like you have in bicycle tires where it just self-seals, maybe you could put that in one of the layers of the suit and self-seal the suit if you have a puncture. John Young was a huge advocate of duct tape. He said, you've got to have duct tape on your moon missions because you're just figuring the leak and you just wrap it up. Yeah, okay. John Young's a smart guy. I thought, well, maybe it could work. But the self-sealing garment within the suit to seal up punctures to give you time, that was an interesting idea as well. What about the zipper? It was a single zipper system, and they said after the first EVA, because that regolith got in there, it scored the little, I don't know what you call them, not races, whatever the parts, yeah. it scored that and started making using the zipper pretty difficult after each subsequent EVA. So he said, you've got to figure out a way to keep the dust out of that zipper. Because, you know, again, they had the perspective of two or three EVAs. And I threw at them, what would this be like if you had to do 30 or you had to do 60 or you were there for six months? And like, this would have been a no-go. This would have been a mission impact. You've got to prevent that zipper from getting gunked up with the lunar regolith. Regolith is nasty stuff. and I'll show you some electron micrographs in a sec. Obviously, this talk around 2006 really got the whole airlock thing going, and Sadney Wagner and the LADTAG team and stuff, we started really kind of working this kind of stuff, and it was brilliant. I think one of the greatest things that came out of really understanding lunar surface operations was trying to implement an airlock or a suitlock system to try to keep the dirt out for a lot of different reasons, both physiological, mechanical, et cetera, et cetera. You've got to keep that dirt out of there. Yeah? I find it interesting that they said protect the zipper and not get rid of it. Did you get any of the other ones? That's a great question, Brian. We never got into an alternative to a zipper. I mean, that wasn"

You've got to keep that dirt out of there. Yeah? I find it interesting that they said protect the zipper and not get rid of it. Did you get any of the other ones? That's a great question, Brian. We never got into an alternative to a zipper. I mean, that wasn't really within the scope of what we were doing. But I guess they felt like you were married to a zipper one way or the other. You're going to have to have a zipper system in there, and you better do that. But no, they didn't actually bring that up. And I certainly didn't think to say, well, what other system would you have instead of a zipper? Good question. Oh, we talked a lot about the timeline. The timeline was huge. How long could you keep going? When do you really think you'd have to cut your EVA short because you're mentally fatigued, physically fatigued? And they said that really, as long as you've got consumables to support you, they felt that they could keep going. That actually being on the moon itself, with the exception of the quads, the forms and stuff, really wasn't that physically taxing. You could keep going. So if you had a recharge station, you could just plug in, recharge your oxygen, your battery, scrub your carbon dioxide. They could keep extending your EVAs. I thought it was very interesting. But they said the main thing was to make sure that you have time to just kind of unload your brain so you're not having to think so much about the timeline and racing to the next experiment and stuff. Because if you read the Apollo timelines, I mean, they were a masterpiece, how they choreographed all these events within the surface timelines. but they're crazy and if you had to do that for three months or six months or something like that you'd fry your crew members and they all said yeah yeah you can do it for two or three evas or maybe even you know a week of eva but beyond that you're going to need to be able to take breaks do something um and and offload the crew members to some extent uh this was another one that was very interesting they said try to establish all your experiments all your heavy stuff in the first week if you're there for an extended surface stay. And this came out and was not apparent because I hadn't seen this anywhere else, but there was a couple of experiments that were actually busted because they fell over the experiment. They fell over a wire that they couldn't necessarily see or something like that. And they didn't come out and say it, but they basically alluded to the fact that you're going to be your most sharp in that first week. So do all your most technically, physically demanding stuff in that first week and then spread everything else out. And again, this was before SEV came up. So we weren't talking about mobile ops. We were just talking about your land, you're doing your stuff, whatnot. And basically just try to get as much stuff done and then spread it out over the period of time so you're at your sharpest, which I thought was pretty interesting. As far as asking for specific details about the time, they said you could definitely do a crew member in cycles of two lunar EVAs on and then a day for maintenance and then have a day off a week. And they said that was key. If you're going to stay there for more than a week, you've got to have a day off to just chill, do something else, which, you know, again, I just wanted their opinion. If they look back and, you know, we're going to do it again, how would they do it to stay sharp, to stay at the top of their game? And that was their recommendation, which I thought was very interesting. It was kind of fun. We took them over to Building 9 when they had the Orion mock-up. We had a lot of our current crew members kind of guiding them through things. But this is funny because Jeff Fox and I had been working on trying to make sure that for like three months that day was going to be perfect. The day actually I brought them all there, they were breaking Orion and all the mock-ups down. and Jeff gets there and is like, what are you guys doing? No one told the guys who were actually running the mock-ups. So we had to scramble the other mock-ups up for these guys. The ladder was an interesting idea. Again, I'm thinking as a doc, you fall from here to here, you're going to bust something, you're going to bust a rib, you're going to torque something. And they actually felt that the ladder itself, the height wasn't as much of an issue, the rung placements were good, everything was fine. It was the glove being able to cinch your hand, that was the tough thing. So if there's some way you could secure yourself into the ladder, if it was higher, you'd have to do that because of just how difficult it was getting up and down. When I showed them pictures of Altair, I don't know if you guys remember Altair. It kind of came and went before some of you may have been here. And it was a 28-foot high ladder. And I showed them that, and they said, you guys are nuts. You guys are asking for a problem something that high. So then we started getting into the, you know, okay, well, how are we going to be able to secure these guys? How are we going to be able to do this? What do you do if you have an incapacitated crew? Remember how you can get them up and down, all these other things? But as far as the power went, they felt that that ladder height was not too bad. It was five feet, eight and a half inches or something like that. It wasn't really that high. I'm going to get to that. I'm going to get to that. Because this starts a very interesting observation that, again, it was one of those things, if I didn't have the opportunity to talk to them face-to-face, I would have never understood this. This was their heart rate data after a typical EVA. about a six-hour EVA from the LMP. And basically you're just watching heart rate. So it's very hard to read, but you can see it ranges from 60 to 140 beats per minute. This is your MET rate and BTUs ranging from about 202 to 2745 up here. And you see that for the most part you exit the hatch, you're out there, you're doing your stuff. The heart rates really aren't getting that high, maybe about 120 up here. Your"

So it's very hard to read, but you can see it ranges from 60 to 140 beats per minute. This is your MET rate and BTUs ranging from about 202 to 2745 up here. And you see that for the most part you exit the hatch, you're out there, you're doing your stuff. The heart rates really aren't getting that high, maybe about 120 up here. Your MET rates are all in the 11, 1200 range here. and then you get here in the last 30 minutes, and you have your highest heart rates, and you have your highest sustained Mert rates. What do you think was going on? And this was duplicated in almost all the Apollo moonwalks. Which states? I think this was Albin's in 12, but I'm not absolutely sure if that's it. But why do you think it was going on there? Because my head's spinning. I'm thinking, okay, you're expending your most energy, your heart rate's highest at the end. Maybe it's because they're deconditioned, and they're just tired at the end of it. or maybe there were some tasks that they had to do and something was going on, or maybe they were carrying a bunch of rocks or something like that. What do you... Pardon? Let's get back to the plan. What specifically about getting back to the plan? Getting in there. This much bigger than the whole thing. It's that, the disk key. The disk key, the display keyboard, was a little computer that sat right above the hatch inside the hatch. And basically, the way they described it to me is you had to kit your coordinates to get back to the command module, okay? and the hatch was too small. So the only way you could actually get in the hatch was to kind of contort your body, kind of roll over to try to get in like this to make sure you didn't hit that because if you hit that, you weren't going to go back to the command module. So it was very hard to actually contort your body to get back in that hatch, which was like, oh, wow. So what would you do if you had someone who couldn't get back in the hatch? And their response was, death is a good motivator. You would find a way to get back in the hatch. Now, I went back, and actually Jerry Goodman and some other guys who were back way, way back then basically told me what ended up happening was when they came out for the requirements for the LEM hatch and they came out with the suit requirements, they had been talking to each other, but somewhere along those lines, the system integration kind of broke down. The right hand stopped talking to the left hand. The LEM guys made the hatch a little bit smaller. The suit guys maybe made the suit a little bit bigger, and no one was talking to each other. And they really didn't know about that, again, with this funkiness that occurred in 1,6G, that this was going to be a problem. And that was basically it, that they really had a hard time getting back into that hatch. And, again, if there was any kind of contingency or something like that, it would have been very interesting. But it explained that graph because I didn't understand it. And I thought, from my perspective, well, maybe they need to be exercised more. They may be able to do something else. How would this be reflected over the period of months and lots of EVAs? and it was none of those things, it was just that the hatch was too small. So this gets back to, I think, the effort that those of us who were doing human system integration at the beginning, we made sure that everybody was trying to talk to everybody else. If we were changing, we had review boards for all those changes and everybody kind of had an idea of what was going on. And they thought you should have a hatch design that's large enough you can just go straight in to that hatch. So that was very interesting. Again, Airlock's a great idea. They were very excited about all those ideas getting back in. This is very interesting. When I read the Apollo 12 debrief, Pete Connery and Al Bean were getting to the edge of the Surveyor Crater, and when they looked down the crater, they thought it was about a 45-degree angle. And all the LRO kind of surveillance photos suggested that it was probably about a 13 to 18-degree slope, and it wasn't going to be that bad to get into. And they're like, there's no way we're going to. It's 45 degrees. We're not getting in there. It's too dangerous. We want to have a way to belay ourselves and secure ourselves. Sure enough, it was about 15 or 16 degrees. And they got in there, went to the surveyor probe, got stuff, and got out. But the point was they said that because on the moon, the sun, depending on the sun angle and different things, you either had sharp blackness or brightness. There really wasn't a line in between. And your field of vision and your depth perception was thrown off. And a number of the Apollo astronauts had said, yeah, the same thing. It was just very weird. That incline seemed steeper or shallower than they actually were. And I went to a briefing at ISIS a couple years ago, and a neuro-ophthalmologist had given a briefing on why that was, and it was fascinating. I can't remember all the reasons why, but why the moon will mess up your eyes and your ability to tell distances, depths, slopes, and stuff. And it was something that, if you're going to be there, you really have to go and figure out how to do accurate assessments and not rely on your eyes at all, which I thought was very interesting. You know, they said that the steepest slope that they encountered was about 26 degrees, and that was the safest that they felt that they could get in and out of. Anything more than that would have been very, very difficult. And actually, on these very steep inclines, they did a lot of sidestepping. They didn't try going straight up or down. They just kind of, you know, it's like skiing. You know, if you're skiing and you drop your ski or something like that, you kind of just sidestep up the hill. That's kind of what they did. Like I said, a lot of ambiguities. As far as pre-flight EVA training, they thought POGO was very beneficial as well as some of the centrifuge training. So keep doing that. They said that one thing on the moon that they didn't anticipate, it was kind of serendip"

They said that one thing on the moon that they didn't anticipate, it was kind of serendipitous that they found, especially with a lot of these drilling experiments, is that that's one of the main examples of how 1,6G actually works against you. Very few 1,6G things are bad. In fact, they said it's the perfect benefit between zero and 1G. But the one thing they said is if you're trying to force things into the ground or do things, it takes a lot of strength that you don't necessarily have to have on 1G because 1G is forcing your drill bits or something into the ground on the moon or certainly with Mars. You're going to have to have much better upper body strength, forearm strength to do these experiments because you don't have the benefit of 1G, which I hadn't thought about. And they didn't have formal exercise programs back then. so that's going to be very important to maintain your upper body strength to be able to do that uh again i said falls were not uncommon and there's lots of risk factors and this is again the main thing is is a doc who's going to be sitting on console they're going to be my crew members i'm thinking about this what kind of injuries do i have to have them trained to be able to treat trained to be able to diagnose what kind of stuff do i have in my kits the injuries what kind of stuff do we have to worry about and like i said they said for the most part they weren't worried about getting hurt with the exception of the forearms the wrist because of the helmet. They said there was a lot of embedded rock and stuff so you could easily kind of twist your ankle, but because the boot was so good, they really never felt they were going to torque their ankle or anything like that. But, you know, I'd see a picture like this. This is Gene Cernan and Schmidt on 17. We're saying they can back through the ranch and unscrew it. Can you do it clockwise? It's better than the trail. Skip. All right, they can give it a slight rotation clockwise as we're lifting out. Okay. Stay there. So, you know, I think this is an important message to take. What is it? Thank you. What is it that saying goes? It certainly always says that the better of good is... I don't remember how it says. But bottom line is things you don't have to fix, don't try to fix it. And they felt pretty well protected in the suit with the exception of the problem with the peripheral vision and the glove. So a lot of things that work in the A7LB from the, you know, the knee and stuff, you try to maintain that if you could. No, I'm sorry. Okay. This is the Apollo 16 landing. Now, one thing, any pilots in here? Okay. One of the things that really scares you if you're a pilot, whether it's flying, you know, around here or landing in the land or on the moon is spatial disorientation. And that's where you lose your vertical horizontal pointer reference and you really don't know what's up, down, right, and left. and your gyros can get spun. That lunar regolith, depending on where they were at in the moon, could plume up up to maybe about 100 feet above ground level. And there were a couple of missions where they were about 100 feet AGL, and they really had no point to reference anymore. And because in space your balance systems, your otoliths, your gravitational receptors turn off because you don't have any gravity, what would happen to your brain and your ability to spatially orientate when you get back to a gravity environment. We really didn't know that. So I really was expecting to have a lot of concerns about spatial disorientation when we got on the moon. So I really pinged the commanders a lot about how did you land this thing, especially being a pilot. I'm thinking, okay, I know what goes into this and how difficult landing is and coordinate effort. And if you don't know what's up, down, right, and left, that's a bad thing. And interestingly, they said, you know, after the 4.3, 4.5-day transit, they really didn't have a lot of concern about spatial disorientation. And their stick-and-rutter technique for landing on the moon was basically just line up your instruments and then just wait. And that's how you land on water at night when you don't have any point of, you just know what your rate of descent is and what your orientation, your attitude is, and then you just kind of wait, and that's kind of what they did. Now, the one who had a potential issue, if we get to the video, was Mr. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin because they had a lot of things that were going on that they hadn't worked out. And one of the things Mr. Armstrong said is when they were trying to land, they kept having this motion in the limb as they were trying to get down and they had a really hard time controlling that in addition to the fact that they're seeing this stuff come up so it was from a pilot standpoint it was fascinating that they could do this but it gets back to their analog training that really helped them but they said because i want to ask them i said well how long did you have to wait once you got to the moon to feel safe to be able to get out and walk around the moon they said right away really once you got your vehicle secured and all your systems were secured they didn't feel disorientated uh where they wouldn't be able to get out there why do i I mean, many of you who've worked with crew members, you know, when they return to Earth, their gyros are spun. They're not standing up. They're wobbling. They're turning into walls and stuff like that. That's what I'm thinking is going to happen on the moon. So I'm trying to think from a timeline standpoint, when would it be safe for them to get out, egress, and start doing EVAs? And they said, really, it was the positioning or the CG in the suit we talked about and then just getting used to 1-6G, but they adapted very, very quickly. So as far as risk factors and injuries, I'll just go back to that quickly. Limit your navigation. to less than 20 to 26 degrees slope"

So as far as risk factors and injuries, I'll just go back to that quickly. Limit your navigation. to less than 20 to 26 degrees slope unless you have aids, rope-blaze systems, rover activities. This was very interesting. Between the commander and LMP, they had a safety belt, a seat belt in the rover, but they said it took about three minutes to harness. And three minutes was a lifetime on the moon, so they just didn't do it. They didn't tell anybody, but they just didn't do it. And when they were driving around, again, not a flat surface, an undulating surface, several of the LMPs felt that they were going to fall and get run over. Whoa, that would have been bad. So, you know, bottom line is make your restraint system or make your suit somehow interface with the vehicle so, you know, you don't have that issue, so it's not going to take forever to be able to do that. And then, obviously, falling from height. But these were really the only three issues that they had concerns about from an injury standpoint. But this one really became a point of contention with Altair because we told them, you know, you can't make 28-foot ladders unless you're going to build a lot of complexity in the system and make sure that they're secured and safe in that. But unfortunately, Altair never really got that far along to actually start working those systems out. But that really went against their recommendations. Certainly, if you're at the rim of a crater, you're going to have to be very careful about what's going on. I learned from the lunar geologist that in some of the craters in Shackleton, where we were going to initially go for a return to moon, that in the permanently shadowed zones, they were about zero Kelvin. They were almost absolute zero. Not something you want to tumble into. So, very interesting. You have to secure yourself. Does anybody remember the 144-hour depress scenario? Are you still having post-consolation stress disorder because of stuff like that? I kind of do. My heart races. I get kind of sweaty. This came up, I don't know, when was it, 2008-ish time frame, and we were spending a lot of time trying to figure out, okay, you get back in your command module, and you've got a six-and-a-half-day transit back to Earth, and now you get a hole in your spacecraft for some reason. Okay. and the assumption is you can feed the leak, but you have just enough time to get in your suit. How are you going to survive in your suit for 144 hours to get back? And we're all sitting there thinking about this. And we're going months trying to figure it out. And I actually, me and a certain number of flight students started going to nursing home populations to look at skin breakdown and tissue problems that you had sitting in feces and urine and all these other scenarios and how to combat that in the suit and what would you have to do to build in the suit to prevent that, to wick away the moisture and all this other stuff. And after a while, your head's ready to explode. And I'm thinking, you know what, I'm just going to go back and ask the guys, how did they do? Because obviously they had to work this scenario. So I emailed a bunch of them, Mr. Armstrong, and I got to know Mr. Armstrong over the next couple of years. And I sent him all of the details and stuff like that. And he emails me back and said, You'll have to forgive me for my poor memory. It's been years since I did that. And then he sends emails, three pages of details, his input on stuff. And I emailed him and I said, sir, your memory is fine. No issues there. And he basically, the long and short was, yeah, they thought about this. Yeah, they were things that they had considered, but it required so many stacked failures. And if you survived the event, the bottom line was they just wanted to build a safer spacecraft. They just put their time and money into making sure the spacecraft was less likely to have that problem. And if it did happen and they were able to survive, they would just deal with it real time. And I think Apollo 13 was the best example of that. They'd train a lot of these things, but it was such a crazy scenario to be able to deal with something like that. So anyway, I thought it was very interesting. But for a lot of issues that came up over the last five, six years before our program got deep-sixed, I would email these guys back and get lots of really good information from them. And it would always amaze me as their, I don't want to say simplistic because that implies incompetence. They're not incompetent. It was just a very simple approach to solving these things and not getting caught up in just crazy details and unlikely or implausible scenarios. But anyway, he was my guest speaker at a meeting in Atlanta in May. I got to spend a lot of time with him, he and my wife. He was a great guy. I really miss him. Okay, so as far as recommendations, we already talked about the timing of your lunar EVAs. You can begin your activities once operationally feasible. You don't really have to do anything special as far as FAM for 1-6G. Obviously, they said that the vomit comments were great rides. You should do that. back in the day they would do 150 parabolas in a day. Now we'll do anywhere from 30 to 60. I think the most I've done at one flight is 66, but they thought nothing of doing 150, 200 parabolas. Wow. I'm fortunate. I don't have a problem. I don't get sick with this stuff. But it's just fatiguing because you're doing that 1.8 pull-up, and after a while you get kind of tired doing that. But these guys, they were crazy. Okay. Lunar rung height, you don't have to change that. make sure that you've got adequate food and water. They emphasize that a lot that that's really going to be important before during and after you could do EVA, one continuous event yeah this is a great comment. Plan the operation on the surface so you protect the crews from themselves what they meant by that was imagine you're on the moon you're staring back at the earth, you've got a"

Plan the operation on the surface so you protect the crews from themselves what they meant by that was imagine you're on the moon you're staring back at the earth, you've got a little dune buggy kind of thing you're going to go nuts out there so make sure that you're always watching out for these guys and a great example of that was on one of the missions we had a shoulder injury, which by far was the most significant injury we had on the moon. A crew member was doing a drilling experiment, and the bit had a defect in it, so it wasn't scooping the regolith out and spinning it back out, so it bound in the regolith. And he tried advancing it with his shoulder. He tried advancing the handle to get it free. And the ground kept saying, you're done, don't worry about it, just go. And he's like, no, I've got to get this done, get this done. And probably ended up getting either a rotator cuff tear or what we call a slap lesion because he was doing that. The thing that was significant is he didn't tell anybody on the ground that that had happened. But in the next 24 hours, he took 14 aspirin because of the pain. Now, I said, okay, well, that's kind of sporty, 14 aspirin in 24 hours, okay. Let's say that had been the second day of, let's say, a month of being on the moon, and you would have just come doing that and not telling the flight student. What would have happened? To anyone's guess, what would have happened if you kept taking that much aspirin? upper GI bleed, you know, severe gastritis, esophagitis, you know, bleeding tendency, you bruise easily, all that kind of stuff. So, you know, make sure, yeah, and they would have run out of aspirin. So they wouldn't have had a heart attack, but okay. All right. Let's see. Again, robotic system. If you have a recharge capability in your rover, because you're spending anywhere from 10, 15 minutes in the rover. Use that time valuably. One thing that they really would like to have had was a navigation aid. And again, because of the undulating terrain, their fixed points, I mean, they knew the lunar surface very, very well, but their fixed points could get obscured because of the terrain, so they would lose that. And one of the commanders wouldn't admit it, because he's a guy, but he got lost, relatively speaking, and kind of drove around about 15, 20 minutes longer than they were supposed to have because he kind of got lost. And they said any kind of inertial navigation system or some kind of aid to help you because, again, considering that surface would have been very, very helpful. Okay, lunar dust. It's everywhere. It's nasty stuff. It got in their eyes, nose, chest, everywhere. And the filtration system on the lunar module did get rid of it to some extent but not as quickly as they would have liked to, especially when they got back to microgravity. When they got back to microgravity, stuff just came up off the floors and was everywhere. Why is the lunar dust so important? Well, again, it's got a high glass content. And there's a respiratory condition called silicosis that actually can be fatal. If you get enough dust burden that your body just overwhelmingly reacts to that glass in your lungs, and you can actually go into severe respiratory failure, almost like a severe pneumonia. Now, you'd have to get a huge dust burden, but the bottom line is, you don't want to mess around with this stuff. Most all the crew members got runny noses, got congestion, itchy, watery eyes. Again, your fingertips, you'd rub your eye and this in your eye and stuff like that. And you didn't have a lot of fluid. Again, it was chlorine. So it was just kind of nasty. Again, stuff you don't think about, but stuff that you can keep the dust away, keep it away. That was Gene Stern after EVA 2. I mean, he was just full of this stuff. And they described it as jagged pieces of Velcro. Okay. It wasn't like little, you know, little pieces of talc or, you know, dust. It's just evil fire ant, satanic stuff that got everywhere and they said, just get this stuff out of there. Well, now there's a companion in this picture and Jack's over here and he's clean. He's out of his suit. But the other thing is, if we wanted to design a system that made it worse, we wouldn't have done a better job than what we did in Apollo. Literally, we had no idea that this was going to be a problem and by the time we realized it, it was a problem too late. And just about every system we had made it worse. You had a belker on the floor and it landed in there. You had boots that sucked it into the exterior, boots that sucked it into the interior. You had systems that just made the problem worse. It's actually a pretty practical problem as long as you acknowledge it. Yeah, you know, and again, our terrestrial relationship with dust and dirt, I mean, I was in Iraq, and, you know, the dust out there is just nasty stuff, but it's nothing like what this stuff was like. It didn't cling to you, and it wasn't as much of an irritant as this stuff was. The cruise had almost allergic-like reactions, but it's not an allergen. It's an irritant. And with that glass in there, you have to make sure that you've got enough saline to wash your eyes out, et cetera, et cetera. And then from a medical standpoint, if you've got someone who got really sick from this stuff, I've got to have steroids. I have to have IVs. I've got to have all this stuff in there. Engineer stuff out. Don't even mess with it. Just get it out of there somehow. The next slide is actually a busy slide. You don't have to read this stuff. It just shows you under electron micrograph what it looks like. And these aren't any of the Apollo astronaut lungs or x-rays. It just shows you an example of someone who is exposed to repeated dust, not smoke, just dust. It gums up your lungs. You can get acute respiratory failure and stuff. It's just nasty."

That LAD tag, that group I was talking about, the Lunar Airborne Dust Toxicity Analysis Group, has been working on animal analogs in the eyes, the skin, the respiratory system to try to find out with lunar simulants and then actual regolith, you know, more characteristics about so we're better informed, like you said, when we go back. But the bottom line is just engineer it out. These guys were huge in analogs, training in as mission-like environment as possible. For those of you who do analogs, you know how important analogs are. You've got to do analogs. But in very budget-tight environments, managers will tell you, no, you can't do it. You just, you know, just practice it here. You've got to go to where going to do it. And most all the members said the LTV saved their lives. You had to be able to train on that thing to be able to get an idea of what it was like to actually land on the moon. And Mr. Armstrong said if he hadn't had that, there's no way he would have been able to successfully land. So, but it was very dangerous. He almost got killed on it. So that's bottom line. We have, if we're going to do stuff like this on the moon and Mars, you have to preserve analog training. Obviously get everything geared up in your or lab, whatever you're going to do, but you've got to go to the environment and do it. And I'll just throw this out there. Does anyone know where this is? Devon Island, Haunt Mars Crater. Following what Apollo told us, we took this the next year out to Haunt Mars, and we did a lunar medical contingency simulation. They've got a 19-kilometer-wide, about 2-kilometer-deep crater, the Haunt Mars Crater. It's the most Shackleton crater-like place on Earth. Totally pristine. It's up by the North Pole. We spent two weeks up there doing this simulation. That was me with Pascal Lee simulating being on the moon, trying to figure out how to take care of an incapacitated crew member. We did this study up there. We basically simulated. Pascal and I were in a crater doing an experiment. We get a call. It was actually Jeff Williams, not the ISS at the time, pretending he was the command module pilot. And Jeff calls down and says, guys, we have an imminent flare. You guys have got to take shelter. We're in the crater. Pascal falls on his drill bit, gets incapacitated. Now I've got to figure out how to get him out of a sloped terrain, knowing that I've got protons coming that are going to fry us, and be able to get him somewhere safe, do a diagnostic evaluation, figure out what's wrong with him, and simulate all this stuff to give us an idea. And I threw this scenario by the Apollo astronauts before we went to do it, because I wanted to figure out what are realistic environments. You guys said it's really hard to get hurt. Is there anything you would really say would be worth our time? They said, yeah, if you guys had a solar flare and you had to get to safety, that would be one that you'd want to do. So that's what we did. And they actually thought it was a pretty good idea. And it was amazing because this place, like I said, there's nothing on Earth like it besides the moon and Mars. That's way the heck up there. And it's way, way up there. Here's the magnetic pole, the North Pole. So we're about a couple hundred kilometers from the magnetic pole. Anyway, and bottom line is, I said that's just some pictures. So Dr. Steve Chappell, who I worked with, who went up there with us, designed this system to be able to use this blay lowering device to be able to get down there and help out. Here's me with the crew member. Here's the system Steve developed. Here's us trying to get this up there. And it was fascinating because before we'd gone up there, I showed Jack Schmidt this, and he's like, you want to have a snow plow in the front of it. I said, what do you mean a snow plow? He said, you're going to want to have a plow device up here because the regular list is going to heap up under your litter and you're not going to go anywhere. I'm like, what do you know? So I go up there and do that, and exactly what he said was going to happen, happened. Every six inches I would push this, where you get all the stuff there. I have to go scoop it away, do a little bit more, scoop away. It took me 45 minutes to get the dead weight, and this wasn't the crew member, he was in a suit, to get him up there. And I actually hurt myself so bad that I actually had to give myself a shot of pain medicine afterwards because my back was in such bad shape. But it was a good learning experience. I learned a ton of information about how to actually do something, albeit improbable, but something. These were my footprints trying to get him to the top there. Anyway, it was very, very valuable. Okay, we're just about done. Radiation, that was one thing I just threw in there, just a little bit for lunar surface ops. It was fascinating for how well-planned Apollo was, the one thing that they just didn't have the technical capability to really understand the impact, or I think a real frank appreciation of how bad this could really be. If they had had a really bad solar event, which they had between Apollo 16 and 17, their plan was to basically just dig a ditch throw the commander in the ditch, the lunar module pilot would get on top of him and try to take the brunt of all the radiation and just cover himself up with the dirt. Not a great plan. But the bottom line is they had no way to assess what the real-time radiation dose was, what was going on, and we've learned since that time that based on the models and the worst events that have occurred that we've measured, you're unlikely to sustain a radiation dose in your suit that would kill you in the suit. However, you would get prodromal radiation sickness over the course of"

However, you would get prodromal radiation sickness over the course of the next few weeks you would get pretty sick. So you would really want to try to beef up your shielding capability, have real-time radiation dosimetry, if you're able to tell that. And really when an SEV came on board, I mean that was really a solution to a lot of problems right there. Instead of digging ditches and doing crazy stuff, you've got that right there. You can get into it fairly quick because you're never going to get very far from your SEV. It was a brilliant solution to a very, very, very costly problem and high emission impact. uh i said these are one thing that i hadn't thought about really and was not a requirement but was thermal protection equipment uh and i went back and talked to fred hayes and jim level about this you know aquarius got down to i think about 39 degrees and odyssey was about 44 degrees they were all hypothermic but they didn't want to pull the suits out because uh odyssey didn't have the ability to really put three suit crew members in or anything like that and it was really bulky because it wasn't designed necessarily for three people so they just stayed in their their jumpsuits and they froze and they said if you can get like a thermal blanket like you know those aluminum blankets you get after you run a marathon you put around you it really traps heat very well put that in there that's brilliant i mean you think you're like how could you docs not think about that you just didn't think about that could you absolutely guarantee you'd never have an electrical failure like you had in power 13 no you couldn't absolutely guarantee has very little volume very little mass you'd throw that in there and it could really help you in a pinch so you Stuff like this, again, it was just being simple, thinking about things that would make you have a bad day just because you didn't think about it. So anyway, right, it's a locator. It is what it is. That's what I would leave. We got under a lot of criticism because it wasn't scientific, the things that we did. We just talked to these guys and stuff. But we talked to the guys who walked on the moon. I mean, it doesn't get any better than that. So they gave us 107 recommendations for future missions. And we wrote this up, we published this, And we took it to all the different disciplines and all these different groups that some of you recognize the names of. We started working all this different stuff to get them in requirement form to make sure that they were implemented. And in a lot of instances, they were already done. People, you know, we have the benefits. We're really blessed to have guys like Dean and a lot of the guys who have been around and still around who are helping us out do this stuff. But then some of the stuff, you know, like the environmental stuff, the battles we fought over a toilet, over hot water, you know, over potable water. Having enough potable water, it was crazy. So this stuff really got our brains spinning. And when we finished this, I think those of us who were doing this felt much better prepared for the next round of Apollo missions, which was pretty cool. This is the whole team all together. A lot of us, folks who aren't around anymore, Ellen, Steve. Of course, this is Mike Duncan, who passed away in May. A lot of great folks here. and then it didn't show Mr. Aldrin or Armstrong or the other guys. It was funny. I got a call one day from a guy who says, Hey, Rick, this is TK Manley. Yeah, an hour? I'm like, let me check my schedule. Yes, sir. And we just talked about toilets and talked about all this kind of stuff, and these guys would just do that over and over again. Other questions? Yes. In your research, did you ever find anything about the portable life support system in any way? I do remember some things that they said about the plis was that the cooling was very efficient. In fact, sometimes it was too efficient and they got kind of cold. I mean, it was, what, 43-degree water going through there? Very cold. And then even despite the falls when they fell backward, there hadn't been any concern that they were going to actually damage the plis. So whatever it was cased in seemed to be working pretty well. No one had ever actually mentioned that there was a problem with that. Also, did you see any information about the breathing and the helmet? Was it sufficient? Was the airflow sufficient? Yeah, it was sufficient. The only concern that they had had was they felt that if they had been exerting themselves more than what they were doing, that it could fog. And they weren't absolutely positive that they would have a fogging problem. And that's why I said in that way they would have to have the manual ability to increase the ventilation flow to blow that condensation off. Did you see any complaints about the noise, the fan noise or anything? Yeah, actually we did. And again, that gets more in the environmental vehicle system lecture. But they said that the glycol pumps on the limb were very loud and they couldn't sleep and it was very onerous. We knew approximately how loud it was as well in the 70 dBA range, which is, I think, the Russian portion of ISS is 72. So it's pretty loud. But it was interesting because when we went back and said, okay, well, here are all the available noise attenuation systems that we have, their comment was, well, we like the noise. We couldn't sleep, and it really was, it bugged us, but the noise assured us that the systems were working. If it got quiet, then we would be afraid something wasn't working and then bad things were happening. So it was kind of like, so their only suggestion was if you could decrease the noise a little bit but keep it at a pretty constant level, but they wanted the noise to make sure everything was working. But yeah, it was loud, and they said it definitely interfered with sleep. Another thing that was pretty, they were impassioned about was being able to put shades on the windows because the light was so bright, it interfered with their ability to sleep. And you know, it was interesting, another thing, and I didn't necessarily buy this until I was in the environment in"

And you know, it was interesting, another thing, and I didn't necessarily buy this until I was in the environment in Devon Island, because in July, August in Devon Island, it's 24 hours of daylight. And they said that, you know, one of our most common problems right now to this day on ice is insomnia and sleep. We use a lot of hypnotics to regulate sleep cycles and melatonin and stuff. And they said with it being bright all the time, they had a really hard time falling asleep. When I was up in Devon Island, I went two weeks. And my day, I would work until about 3 in the morning. I'd take 10 milligrams of Ambien, and at 5.30, I'd be wide awake again. And I did that for two weeks, and I was never tired until I got to a dark environment. When we got to Ottawa, they couldn't wake me up. I'd slept 14 hours, and I was really out of it. and it was exactly the way Apollo described it. It's very interesting. So having shades so you can kind of get into a dark environment, shut off that normal stimulation to your pineal gland so you can secrete melatonin was huge. And they were very reluctant to take medications. And there were some potential impacts with that too because there was some misunderstanding about how long dexedrine worked and stuff. So a lot of them, the plan was before they reentered, they wanted to be able to take amphetamine to really make sure that they were woken up. But they were afraid that if they took it too soon, they would bonk on re-entry and they'd be really tired. So they did, and so they landed really, really tired, not knowing that the half-life was long or it would have been fine. But stuff like that, there was this little thing. One of the commanders, one of the main things he complained about while he was on the moon was no one put a nail clipper in his kit, his personal kit, and his nails were too long, and it really bugged him in the glove. And he had to bite his nails, and then they were really bleeding and irritated and stuff like that. And you're thinking, someone could have thought about putting a nail clipper in there. They can't be that big a deal because, you know, in the Army we say it's the bullet you don't see that gets you. And that easily, you know, it just goes without saying, these are all things that came out of these conversations with these guys that you just don't see in debriefs at all."

He has a Master's in space science from University of Houston, Clear Lake. As the ISS EVA Increment Manager, he's managed many increments for various expeditions. He's worked with the Russian EVA community. He's trained with STS-60 and STS-71 crews with MOD Space Shuttle Flight Control and Propulsion Group. He's been with Hamilton-Sunstrand since 2000 and is currently working as the ISS EVA Increment Manager in the EVA XA office. He is in charge of increment 25, ISS EVA maintenance, and is the XA representative for the Japanese HTV. Cinda Cholan has a BS in thermal and environmental engineering from Southern Illinois University. She has an MBA and an MS in environmental science from the University of Houston, Clearlake. She joined NASA as an engineer in the crew and thermal systems division. She was the Deputy Technical Manager of CTSD. She was the Technical Manager of Science Engineering Analysis and Test Group, Test Contract, sorry. And she's currently the Deputy Project Manager of EVA Technology Development Project, where she helps develop technology for integrated advanced space. And today they are presenting Post Shuttle ISS Operations, sorry. Is that the EVA Ops? EVA Ops. Yep. Thanks for the introduction and thanks for everybody coming out today. She said I'm Bill West and this is Cinda Cullen from engineering and I work in XA. And Vince Witt was also, this is actually a paper that we wrote for a conference and it's going to capture all of this work that was done on a project that was called EVA 2010, which I'll explain what that is. There's an awful lot of people that were involved in this and the three of us did a paper, but there's a, I don't want to leave, there's so many names that worked on this, I can't name all of them. It's just there are a lot of folks involved, and we really appreciate all the work they did. Next slide. Okay, so the suit that we use today on ISS, the EMU, the Extravehicular Mobility Unit, was designed in the 1970s for shuttle operations. And at that time it was a very simple concept. It was up and down, one to three EVAs per flight on the shuttle. And once it was returned to the ground it came back here to JSC to Building 7, right over here, and they did refurb and testing and prepared it for the next flight. And occasionally it would head back up to the Hamilton-Sunstrand plant in Windsor Locks, Connecticut for a full refurbishment. It was not a long duration space suit in any way. So we get to ISS and the initial plan was to build an ISS specific suit. Well as everything happens around here, they ran into cost and schedule and cost and so the decision was made, well we'll just use the EMU and not build a new suit. So now we're in a position where it's not going to be one to three EVAs on a shuttle flight in return. Now it's going to stay up for longer and longer. So when it became the ISS suit, they certified it for two years on orbit or 25 EVAs and that eventually went to a three year certification. This was in the 90s. But the plan was still the same. It was going to be rotated on a shuttle mission. So it would go up, be used by the crews for stage EVAs, return back to the ground. Well, following the Columbia accident and the decision to retire the shuttle, that whole plan kind of went out the door. With ISS as a standalone program, depending upon the EMU to perform all the contingency EVAs, like we just did a couple weeks ago on the pump module, we had to find a way to continue supporting the ISS without the shuttle. Which, once the team dug into it, really forced a change in the entire operational philosophy of how we're going to use this hardware. Not used as an EVA, but the time we go out the hatch, the EVAs, the folks watching it, will look just like we did the pump module EVA. But getting the hardware and maintaining the hardware on orbit is going to be completely different now that the shuttle is gone. We no longer have the ability to rotate hardware up and back. Eventually we may with something like the drag and return, but when we started this, that concept was not there. We were told you launch, you fire and forget. It's going to launch the station, you keep it going as long as you can, you dispose of it, and then you resupply it. And so we had to, I mean, bringing suits home, is they not only, if we have a problem on orbit with a suit, the failure investigation occurs once the hardware is returned to the ground. And the engineers and technicians that operate with this, that work with the suits can take the suit apart on the ground and do a full failure investigation. You can't do that anymore. We have to find ways to do failure investigations on orbit, to do diagnostic testing on orbit. once a suit is to repair hardware on orbit, not just the suit, but other pieces of our hardware too, our tools, airlock systems, and then to recertify it for manned or human usage. So just real quick, those aren't familiar. The EMU, the Extra Vehicular Mobility Unit, is the spacesuit itself. And then you've got your liquid cooling garment. You've got your heart upper torso, you've got your legs. The critical part, of course, is the backpack, the life support system. And there was a lot of focus on the EVA 2010 on this piece of hardware. There are only 12, we call them plisses, there's only 12 plisses left in the fleet. There were 16 originally built under the original contract. Two were lost in Challenger, two were lost in Columbia. and so we have 12 left. And keeping, you know, we would launch this and then bring it home, but we can't do that anymore. We had to find a way to not only extend the certification, the life of this on orbit, but also how are we going to repair components on orbit, replace components on orbit, do testing and failure investigation on orbit, and Cinda will get into that in a little bit. And there's all, these are all the components, but they're all the rest of these, electrical harnesses, drink bags, all comprise what we call the EMU. The soft goods, which is the heart, upper torso, the arms and the legs, those we do make new versions of. There is a limited production of those by ILC Dover. And so there the concept is instead of bringing this stuff home, once again we're going to launch it up and then we're going to burn it it up when its life is done. We'll get into more details on this, I'm just doing an introduction of what our hardware is. Along with the suit, of course, a very important part is the tools. This is just an example of some of the tools we have. Over 300"

We'll get into more details on this, I'm just doing an introduction of what our hardware is. Along with the suit, of course, a very important part is the tools. This is just an example of some of the tools we have. Over 300 tools in our inventory, it's quite extensive. Some of the common ones that you see on every EVA, we have safety tethers. You can see the, we call it the peanut here, with the reel. We have an 85 foot reel and a 55 foot reel. We have the PGT, which goes out on almost every EVA. And that requires calibration. PGT is like the suit, it's brought back to the ground, is calibrated and serviced on the ground and then relaunched. There's a limited number of PGTs. Now the PGT has to be launched and calibrated in orbit. and its life extended as long as possible and then disposed of. And then we have a lot of other tools, the modular mini workstation, which is this, you see on every EVA, the large amount of tools on the crew members' chest right here. All these things had to be looked at and addressed. We had to go through all 300 items and identify those items that either we had to extend the certification on orbit or would require some sort of repair on orbit. And then of course there's the airlock systems, which includes our ability to charge our batteries, provide power and cooling to the suit when they're in the airlock, donned off the suits, store our hardware. Stowage is a big, big deal, which we'll talk about in a little bit. Because along with everybody else in the community, we're asking for more space to stow stuff. And we're being told the same thing, no. And, of course, our ability to egress the ISS and go do the task. Okay, before Cinda gets into the individual components, just kind of set the stage. Losing the shuttle in the big picture is a tremendous loss in the amount of up and down cargo mass. This was taken from the Augustine Commission. And you can just see here our up mass in kilograms and our unpressurized up mass is our ability to take ore or use up. We will be dependent upon the HTV, ATV in progress for a while until Dragon and Cygnus become operational. So we, how this affects our planning and the assumptions that we had to make in the EVA is we have to assume limited up mass capability compared to the environment we're in today. That really drives us to extend our hardware out as much as possible. And then we have also limited opportunities to launch. And also the logistics of getting pressurized systems which our EMU has got a pressurized bottle in it, 6000 PSI pure O2 emergency oxygen system called the SOP. Today it's taken to KSC via truck, leaves USA facility here in Houston, goes to down I-10, goes to KSC. Now we've got to, we're going to launch it on the HTV, which is the plane we've got to fly this, which is a whole bunch of logistics and international regulations in air transport. And this also is from the Augustine Commission, but it shows kind of the challenge we're going to have getting out later in the middle of this decade. This green line here is what's called our baseline capability, and that's the shuttle, the progress, and the Soyuz today. This dark part right here is you add the international partners, ATV and HTV, and this light blue is the commercial guys. And so you can see when this was written, and we assumed one flight in 2011, most of the cargo capability was taken up by the ATV and HTV. These guys, of course, are not flying. Maybe next 2011 they'll start flying. But we depend more and more on them as we go out and we get into a deficit in the middle of the decade. Once again, how this comes into play is we're starting to load our hardware up on these last flights. Most of our hardware, like our life support system, has got a six-year certification. So if you start to project out at the time that we have a deficit in our up mass capabilities at the same time that we, EVA, need to start replacing our hardware. Okay. And these are a couple of the assumptions that we made. Like I said, the hardware is disposable and will not be returned. That may change with the Dragon, but we have to assess the loads of bringing something down by a vehicle landing in the ocean with a slap down and the entire environment that it will go through. Also, we were told by the program, eight EVAs a year is what to plan for. So really two EVAs per increment, assuming four increments a year. And that's what we build our contingency EVA logistics for. We were told specifically to plan on the Japanese HTV, especially for our life support system, our PLIS. Other vehicles may be utilized. We have launched stuff on progress after the Columbia accident, and we will be launching on ATV2. There will be an EVA, some EVA hardware launching, and so use is utilized for LUVs. And then, of course, once the commercial vehicles start flying, I think we'll probably utilize them quite a bit because the logistics is the same as the shuttle. We ship our stuff to the Cape as we do today. Instead of going out to the VAB and Pad 3 and A and B, it goes across to Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. And then extending our hardware. Senator will talk more about this in a minute, but we extended our EMUs to a six-year on-orbit. That's six years between maintenance cycles. So we can leave it on orbit for six years. We call it a mega. And this is one of those instances where we came up with a term and then we had to make it an acronym. So in SIN EMI we're trying to remember what MEGA stood for and we couldn't so you see how successful we were in that. But if you look today on a lot of the documentation, the four EMUs on orbit today have got an M in front of them and that signifies this is a MEGA EMU. And SIN EMI will explain what a MEGA is. And then we extend our certification of our tools. And this is just a pretty picture of what our concept is. Once before shuttle fully retires, we'll have our four megas on orbit, our four mega EMUs. And then of course after that, as the megas are used up, they'll be disposed of in the HTV. And"

And then of course after that, as the megas are used up, they'll be disposed of in the HTV. And then of course HTV is also launching our, one at a time, they'll launch our replacement mega units. And then we'll continue to support 80 EVAs a year, or as many as necessary, past to 2020 and beyond. In fact, when we started the 2010, the official date was 2015, but we were told unofficially planned for 2020. That's what we worked to is 2020. With that, I'll hand it over to Cinda. Do you think we'll really dispose of the EMUs or will we learn how to? Well, that's a really good question, and I don't know the answer to that. The program has kind of indicated if we can get the EMUs, the PLISs back, that we plan to do that and do a refurb. I took a visit out to SpaceX, and when I was out there touring them, They said that they were going to have a pressurized cargo for potentially use. And there may be some commercial opportunities for us to bring it back. Right now, the current plan is to not. I think really the answer, Bob, will get to be political. Because, yes, we can bring these back and reform. But these things were built in the 70s, and we're still flying them today. So balance that against the desire to go build a new suit of some type for ISS and then beyond. Because the ISS does become a test bed, especially how we're going to be operating now, is how we're going to operate in the future past low Earth orbit. So that discussion, we have enough suits to last us to about 2020. In reference to the HTV, maybe you have it up there, I can't see it, but how many flights can we count on? There's one HTV flight a year and one ATV flight a year. And then multiple progresses and then whatever rate the commercial guys can go. But for proven vehicles today, ATV and HTV is one flight per year. And currently the ATV, the loads on the ATV just are not acceptable right now for the way things stand for the PLIS. right there's other components we could look at for that but not the plus yeah so right now for the police we're targeting the HTV so what I'm going to talk about a little bit is the 2010 project which is a project that got kicked off at the beginning to look at the plans for how we're going to handle this hardware and how once the shuttle retires. So right after the decision was made to retire the shuttle, a team was kicked off and they were actually sequestered. They were put out to kind of brainstorm how we were going to handle this and how we were going to provide the hardware with the shuttle retiring. So they came back with a plan and we pretty much stuck to that plan over the last couple of years from what came out of that team. And one of the biggest components of what came out of that team was how we were going to handle the PLISs, as we're calling mega PLISs, because there were several things that had to be done to the PLIS to make it acceptable to stay on orbit for six years versus the three years. So we went I guess another component was we had a certification process that we went through to convert the three-year certification to six-year certification. And then we were looking at the alternate launch vehicles, which ones we could deal with, which ones we could accept the hardware, pieces of the hardware. We also looked at what we call removable replacement units, things that we could replace on orbit. We have ORUs on orbit for certain components, but there are certain things we just have not done on orbit. And so we went and looked in more depth of what we could and couldn't do for change-out on orbit. We also looked at the tools extension, certifying those so they could extend for even potentially beyond the six-year limit of the PLIS. And one of the other big components that I got an opportunity to work with was how we were going to deal with the water supply for the cooling system for the suit. Whereas before the shuttle provided the cooling water and now we're looking at the station providing that with the hardware, with the new hardware they have on orbit. on orbit. The WPA system, we were looking at how we could use the WPA water as our supply water. And of course the logistics and stowage. So as we headed down this path of putting together this mega unit, this mega-plist, it was a whole array of details that accompanied planning for the PLIS. We had to go through an entire refurbishment process to get this six-year certification and part of that was an objective to look toward 25 EVAs and to try to get those with different components that made up the PLIS. One of the primary things that we did was is to re-coat the water tank structure, the aluminum horn, and the sublimator. And that was to prevent any corrosion associated with the water contact. Also, all the components, we wanted to get all the certification. Each component of the PLIS has different certification life. So what we tried to do was get all of that life to line up so that all the pieces could at least meet the six-year certification. And some components actually go beyond that. Some of them go on to 15 years and such. So essentially we tried to reset the limited life on the PLOS. Our objective was to have 7 to 9 megas that were planned to support ISS beyond 2010. And then what we would do is use the shuttle to deliver those early megas to the station. like Bill said, so that we could secure four on orbit before the shuttle would actually retire. And then we looked at the alternate launch vehicles. And right now, we're working very closely with the Japanese for the HTV. We've been meeting with them. Some of our team have actually gone to Japan to try to look at the integration of the hardware. And I will actually show you some pictures of how we're going to do that. And then look at some of the components from the MEGAs that may be salvaged prior to being discarded. And I guess our plan is that we're operating on the 22 project is that we would discard the pluses once the certification is expended and we would not have them. But like Bill said, we're open to looking at other opportunities. So the current certification"

And then what we would do is use the shuttle to deliver those early megas to the station. like Bill said, so that we could secure four on orbit before the shuttle would actually retire.

And I guess our plan is that we're operating on the 22 project is that we would discard the pluses once the certification is expended and we would not have them. But like Bill said, we're open to looking at other opportunities. So the current certification is three years. We took this effort to take it to six years. The first set was 2014-2016 timeframe, and then targeting for 2020 for the next set of MEGAs. And then we also looked at potentially a diagnostic kit or different tools that we could use to say if we had a leak in the PLIS, there was different techniques that we're looking at like these little flanges where you could detect water leakage and they were called like almost like litmus paper approach to determining water leakage and such so we're looking at a whole kit of things that we could do to determine the health of the plis for certification someone asked about the HTV this is the current configuration of the HTV and the plis will actually be launched in a pressurized component of the plist. And this is, let me see it a little bit better. Let's see. It's the forward compartment? Yeah, right here. Here's the rack, the HTV rack. And what we'll be doing is we will have each compartment is a cargo compartment on the HTV. and the PLIS won't actually fit in that compartment. So we had to design a hardware structure to mount the PLIS on the exterior of the cargo. So this panel right here we would actually mount the PLIS on the exterior but it would be in the pressurized cargo of the HTV. These are the different pieces that we looked at for the hardware extension. Of course the primary the The pliss was the main item that we looked at here, but also the helmet. We extended the life of the helmet. We looked at the hut, the secondary oxygen supply, and the display controls. But everything but the pliss will be soft-stowed, even the SOP. Okay? So we found that the loads wouldn't affect the soft \u2013 the pressurized oxygen bottles in the secondary oxygen supply. This is a really good picture I was going to point out, Cinda, that remember how I talked about the change in operational philosophy? Well, today, when we launch an EMU in the shuttle, it is completely assembled and usually launched in the airlock. Now, for the later megas, you're going to have the heart upper torso launched separately from the PLIS, launched possibly separately from the secondary oxygen pack. The DCM, which is the forward display module, will be launched separately. The crew will have to put all of this together on orbit and go through procedures to check it out. Where all that is done today, Building 7 and at the Cape, the crew is going to have to do it now. So this is a major change in operational philosophy. And we've had the crew over to Building 7 already to do some testing, so to speak, on how they would even do the diagnostics on the PLOS and checking it out, because they've never had to do that before. Like Bill said, it was all together before. It's going to be all separate now. So the crew is going to be doing a whole different job than they did before when it comes to dealing with the suit. This is the rack I was talking about. So here's the cargo component in the front panel. So this is an adapter that we have been developing with individual isolators. And this launch adapter will actually go on the exterior of the panel. And we've had a lot of analysis going on on that hardware. And we call it the launch adapter package. So this is the plis on the exterior. And this is the frame that it's going to mount against. Is there an enclosure that goes around that? Or does it launch just like it's shown on that left-hand side? No, it'll be launched just like it's shown right here. unless there's been any changes to that. Marianne's with us today. She's from Hamilton Sun Strand. She's the current project manager for Hamilton Sun Strand. She's the glue that moved the project. So I worked with Marianne as I worked on this project. So if there's been any changes on it, I'm not aware. So it would be launched just like it is. We talked about that, Rich, putting a cover because it kick loads, especially not crew kick loads, but there's eight of these racks inside of the HTV, and this can load in any one of those. So if this gets loaded and then there's other technicians in there loading other stuff, we don't want it kicked or damaged. So trying to work with, especially because it's got a 6,000 PSI Puro II bottle in the SOP. So, yeah, there's, in fact, I know we actually went to the Cape and watched them load stuff using their rack loader to get an idea for the gym to get it because it'll be using the same process for the HTV. But this will have to be, this is light enough, two people could do it, but it's going to have to be with hoists and moved in. And then there's a whole process just on loading this thing. It'll be done by Japanese technicians. It won't be, once again, we won't be doing it. We'll be sitting there watching, but they'll be doing it. Essentially, it'll go as a prepackaged component. And then the Japanese will take it over and then they will get it all set up ready to go. So we'll essentially be handing it over to them and nervously watching. Is this the same launch fixture? You said that you couldn't launch it on an ATV. Is this the same structure that won't pass the loads on an ATV? This is the one we initially assessed for the ATV. Go ahead, Mary Ann. The loads were too high. I don't think, Bill, you probably know a little bit more about the ATV, but I don't think logistically we could actually get it in as easy as we could the HTV. And we also have a contingency plan where we could launch on the Russian vehicles if needed. We have done a fit check to get through a hatch over in Building 9 last year, so we do have a contingency plan. That's a backup. Yeah. Yeah, we have video. We got the clearance for the Russian vehicle, so I think we're going to be good as a backup plan. It's built for the 800mm hatch, so it would fit into the ATV because it's the 800mm hatch. But, yeah, the attachment was different"

But, yeah, the attachment was different. And the time that we did this, they hadn't launched ATV1 yet, and their load predictions were too high. and one of the axes were some of the plis components. And so I don't know if we've gone back yet and re-looked at the data from ATV1 to see, but right now we're just focusing on HTV. I just wonder if you could build a film enclosure or something like that to help with the boats. And if we launch with the commercial guys, we haven't even assessed Dragon or Cygnus on how we'll do that yet. Right. Okay. This is the hut. This will be soft-stowed. And the display control module, so this is the HUT looking at a soft-stow configuration and likewise with the display control module. This is a little different view of how we would look at the panel or soft-stow configurations for the different, the HUT, the helmet, SOP, DCM. And I guess one of the things I should say, we are not looking at the crew members when the, if we deplete the oxygen in the secondary oxygen supply, we're not looking at the crew to resupply that. Even though the pressure could potentially accommodate that on orbit, we're not looking to do that. Our engineers would have a heart attack at Hamilton Sun Strand if we tried to do that. Okay, the other thing we are looking at is the troubleshooting. And I mentioned to you that we've done a couple of those already where we brought the crew over. We tried to do some troubleshooting with some issues or how to detect certain indicators of the, you know, leakage in the PLIS. And so this is us looking at different, looking at the lessons learned, looking at some high probability failures and how we could accommodate that. You know, like CO2 sensors. Maybe it would be better sending additional ones, having them on orbit ready rather than trying to diagnose it in more detail. So we also are looking at how we can repair and replace different components. One of the things we're looking here at is these custom captive fasteners. You can see here that if you are, if you would have to replace a component on the plis, these are fasteners that are captive so that if you take it off and you have to diagnose it, you're not going to lose the screws and the component as it mounts. This is one of the components that EMU transport flow meter. This is a meter that we're looking at as one of the items in our diagnostic toolkit that we're developing that we can monitor different characteristics that we're seeing in the place so that you can detect water leakage the different the health of the of the EMU we're looking at you know I mentioned the even the sublimator flange leakage detection strips the bent loop leakage detection fixture and some cabling to download. One of the things right now with the electronic the ECWS, the electronic caution and warning system, is that we get the data back and we do the diagnostics on on the ground. Or we can do it, we're looking at having the cabling so that the data from the ECWS can be converted over to a laptop and the data would be available to the crew and to the ground so we can do diagnostics as well. The PGT Torque Analyzer Kit, do you want to talk about that? Yeah I can talk a little about when we went and looked at the tools like I said there's over 300 tools on orbit, one of the ones that immediately stood out was the PGT. It's probably one of the most complicated tools that we have. What makes it difficult for the EVA 2010 project was it has to be calibrated in orbit. It has certain torque values. It's programmed between it has to maintain that calibration for about currently it's two years and then return to the ground for ground calibration. So Oceanair went off and they built a torque analyzer kit which you can see in the picture right here. This is actually a commercial off the shelf kit that they modified for the PGT and the objective is to launch this kit. In fact it's already manifested and I think it goes up in one of the upcoming flights. And the crew once again will do the task that's being done on the ground today by the ground techs and they will perform PGT calibrations and hopefully we can make them. The goal right now is five years and I think if we get the five years and everything and the PGTs are still within calibration we'll continue to use them. So, but the other tools. Question, have we seen the PGT come back out of calibration? That I don't know. I think we have in the past but I don't know. And another question is if it's out of calibration, do you electronically go in with a laptop and recalibrate it? Yeah, I don't know how they... Yeah, that's once you've got the proof procedures to recalibrate it. Yeah, you're right. And if it's out of calibration, you guys will have to, working with the engineer, have to come up with procedures to recalibrate it. I have to say a lot of the effort has been focused on making sure that we launch our hardware safely. The diagnostics, we're looking and trying to anticipate what tools we'll need to actually do the diagnostics. But one of the philosophical things that we're looking at is that we have failures. We've got history of failures. We're not pre-writing procedures for those failures because we have a lot of history with that already. We're going to be looking at, as the failure occurs, we'll be pulling together the team as needed, just as we do today, to address those failures. Okay, the EMU cooling is provided by the sublimating water to vacuum and we have, like I said earlier, the water is currently provided by the shuttle. We're going to look at the WPA system to provide that water. We've done quite a bit of analysis as well on the ground and on orbit. We've actually gotten samples back from the WPA to analyze to see whether the water was going to be sufficient enough. And thus far, as we can tell, the water is of high enough quality for us to use it. There were certain places that we actually took the samples and we're in the process of trying to get samples from different places where you actually, whether the on exchange bed was changed out or not for the water. So that's one of the"

There were certain places that we actually took the samples and we're in the process of trying to get samples from different places where you actually, whether the on exchange bed was changed out or not for the water. So that's one of the things we're looking at. Is the concern like reaction products with the component, with the materials that make up the plis? That and the quality, the high, you know, is it high enough quality to meet our objectives? Remember after Columbia, we lost EMU capability because we had bugs and gunk coming from the heat exchanger water. And so we're very mindful of the water we put into the cooling loops because it has to go through the fans and the fan pump separator. And so it has to reach a certain level of purity. And so we've been testing for that. Yeah, the sublimator is the thing that's most sensitive to the contaminants. And when you have it on the ground, you can take it apart and look at it. And we're just not going to have that capability on orbit. So making sure that the water is of highest quality that we can use, that would be, I mean, that's the optimum. So we do use a lot of water. It would be better to use the WPA as it is. We also looked at putting another, I guess, a filter or ion exchange bed in advance of that to make sure that when it comes into our system that it's ultra pure. A little, and part of it had to do with just, just ensuring that the quality of water was what we needed versus what came out as the effluent of the WPA. Good enough to drink that you can't even go to the bottom of the water. That's right. Bottom of the water. Alright, so do you want to talk this one? Yeah, I'll talk logistics and stowage. So, as you can imagine, everybody, every organization that has hardware on station today is asking probably for more more stowage and we're no different than than anybody else. Today, or in the past, we've had three EMUs in orbit that we've rotated. Now we've got four on orbit and that and plus we have two hard upper torsos. We have one orbit and we have another one launching in the PMM. So we're gonna, that right there drives more stowage. I could go to the next slide, Simba. Yeah, we've, we have actually requested from the program to increase our allocation by 21%. This is for all of them. Because we're not only launching more EMU hardware, we're trying to get as many tools as we can up there to pre-stage our tools. And all of our other, our all clear hardware that we use to service the suits, our PGT tax, all of this stuff we're asking, okay, I think we went from 88 CTBs to 105 CTBs was our request and we of course laughed at. But we continue to ask. So our goal is to have sufficient number of tools plus redundancy to support the eight EVAs a year. Now are we really going to do eight EVAs a year? We really don't know. It depends on the number of failures on station. Now, I didn't put in this pitch, but those of you that have been following, the post-shuttle retirement EVA tasks are starting to build up. The idea that we would get to final assembly and we would call it a day and we would just do the contingency EVAs is not panning out. We are, tasks are coming forward that will be planned tasks, not contingency tasks, but planned tasks on ISS post-shuttle. In fact, I think the last count, we were at like 12 to 15 tasks post-shuttle. So it's going to be a challenge. In fact, if you go to the next, one of our biggest challenges, we talked about the water, we talked about stowage. Oxygen resupply is one of our big issues. We get our oxygen for our suits from the high-pressure gas tanks on the airlock. Those tanks are resupplied today by the shuttle. Once the shuttle goes away, there's no system in place to refill those tanks, so we have a limited amount of EVA capability in those tanks. I think we're at, well, the next slide will show up, but we have, yeah, go there. Depending on what type of pre-breathe we use, if we do the campout where the crew goes into the equipment lock equipment locked the night before, closes the hatch, drops the pressure, breathes pure O2, we use about 25 pounds of oxygen from those tanks. If the crew does not do that, the other option is to get into the suit for four hours before the EVA and breathe pure O2 used between 7 to 10 pounds depending on the crew member. So it makes for a lot longer time in the suit because you're four hours in the suit and you go do a six and a half half hour EVA versus being in the airlock and then doing your EVA. So we have to manage our O2 supply and be mindful of it because we can't resupply it until, those of you know the NORS, the nitrogen oxygen resupply system is a system being built by Boeing that will launch up the station, not big, but 6,000 PSI tanks of nitrogen and oxygen, launch the station and we'll refill these high pressure gas tanks on the airlock. And that will give us our comfort margin again that we can go do as many EVAs as necessary to support the station. But until that happens, there's going to be a lot of discussion at the program level, okay, those tasks I was talking about, how many of those do we really need to do? And how many of those can we kick the can down the road? So like I said, it's going to be a completely different environment than we've been doing. Yes, ma'am. What's the schedule for the Norse? I think 2013 is the first launch. Bill, have you taken into account in this overall planning and study, you know, what can be done as a backup with the Russian Orlan suit in terms of repair and logistics? Funny I said Gary. We did it for EVA 2010 and that was kind of the direction that we were given. When we started, those of you who have been around long enough know that we used to have something called dissimilar redundancy. The crews were trained to use both spacesuits and so Russians were trained in EMU, they were trained on tasks in the NBL, Americans did oral on EVAs and"

We did it for EVA 2010 and that was kind of the direction that we were given. When we started, those of you who have been around long enough know that we used to have something called dissimilar redundancy. The crews were trained to use both spacesuits and so Russians were trained in EMU, they were trained on tasks in the NBL, Americans did oral on EVAs and they were trained at the Hydrolab in Russia. The program, when we went to sixth crew, we went to segmented operations, and the program decided, okay, we're not going to do that anymore. So right now the only people that can use the EMU are U.S. OS crew members, and they don't train in the orel line anymore, and the Russians no longer train in the EMU. So we really don't have, and we've actually used that in increment nine when we lost our EMUs because of the water problems. We had an RPCM go out, And so we sent Fink and Badalk out in Orlons to the U.S. segment. They replaced the RPCM and then came back. So that capability, I think they're starting to rethink that a little bit because we have been told lately that one Russian will get EMU training and one American will get Orlon training. So they're starting to realize that that is a valuable capability to have. Okay, and this logistics training for the future, Is there repair or, you know, where you're going to have to repair something on station that you must use the EMU, you can't use the Orlon? There are. Now you're really going back. With beginning of station, we used to have Orlon wetsuits in the NBL, and we did a couple of runs with the Orlon on our Big 14 contingency task, though it wasn't called Big 14 at the time. And John, I don't know if any of you MOD guys remember what the results of that was. I do remember, or Bob, that the Orlon doesn't have the mobility that the EMU does to get into some of the tight spaces, especially when they've got to go into the truss. The reason I say that, you know, when you have a backup, that's fine. But in your logistics planning for the EMU, if there's an area or something that the Orlon can't do, You may want to up your logistic. I think right now for simple tasks like an RPCM, those type of very simple tasks the Orelon is capable of doing it. I think when you get into pump modules, FHRCs, TUS reels, some of the larger ORUs that require the crew members to really get into the truss, I think the Orelon, yeah, we'd have to go do runs. But today the plan is EMU, U.S. side, U.S. contingency. Orlon, Russian side, Russian contingency. Some of the things I remember is we've got the focus rate thing covered. We've got a universal focus rate that will work with either suit. But one of the issues I remember is the big, dumb Russian gloves. You could hardly even operate the pit pins to change the extensions out of an Indian power tool. So that's one of the things that kind of stuck out as a super-pass. Most of your other tasks you hope are big, dumb, handling a big mass. That stuff's manageable, but that power tool thing is not. Have the Russians changed the drives since? And they're still operating at the same pressure. They operate at a higher pressure than we do. This is kind of a snapshot of where we are today. By the time shuttle retires, which will be 2011, Looks like now probably mid-2011. We will have everything in place. All of our megas on orbit. We'll have our six-year cert is done. We'll have our on-orbit repair and replace capability in our diagnostic kit. We'll be certified to launch on the HTV. Our water, we should have all done our testing so we'll know about our water, our tool certs, and our PGT capabilities. So we're pretty close now to being ready. The only yellow is logistics, and that will always be yellow. So, yes, sir? Going back to the oxygen and nitrogen recharging, that right there, only 13 EVAs are capable? If we did nothing but campouts, we have about 13 EVA's capability between the end of the shuttle with full pressure tanks and when we get NORs to resupply. So we have 13 EVAs. And actually that's kind of misleading because one of those tanks is sitting on ELC, so you got to do an EVA to switch it out. So you actually use one of your EVAs to get more O2. Oh, so that's including the additional reserves? Right. Okay. Yeah. But then if you went to the other, the in-suit pre-breathe? Yeah, I forgot. It drops it down because you're using 7 to 10 pounds of O2 versus 25 pounds of O2. So you would be up to? Yeah, in the 20s. Oh, okay, in the 20s. Yeah. But once again, you know, if it's a simple failure that our MOD guys say, you know what, guys say you know what this is probably going to take three hours to do you can do an in suit and then go do your EVA if it's a pump module and FHRC if it's a one of our real complex multiple EVA components that's a long that's a long time to be in a suit so once again what the weather look at the failure look at the EVA and then decide okay which pre-wreath when who's and then look how much O2 we got. So the shuttle can directly recharge those tanks? I'm not quite sure how. I think they run a line if anybody knows. Run a hose. Yeah, they run a hose. Okay, so it'll be recharged at the end of the last shuttle flight. Yeah, the last shuttle flight will leave full tanks. We're gonna fill them on ULF-5. We're protecting for 200 pounds of O2 transfer, so that should get them really full. Right. And they've got a couple of other ideas out there. You can see they're working actually. There's NORS, there's CASIO. Don't ask because it's not EVA. I just know it's an off-the-shelf system that will basically draw oxygen from the station air and pump it into these tanks. It's much like a medical. It's an off-the-shelf medical system today that people use with O2 tanks. And"

And then there's an interim NORS, which I don't know a lot of details about, But all those are designed to try and get, and this is like the water, oxygen in the suit, we're, if you think we're, we're, we're. Picky. Picky, thank you, that's the word I was looking for. Picky about water in the suit. We are extra picky about oxygen in the suit. because it's a pure O2 environment and that oxygen has to hit a very, very high pristine level. And so... Yeah, that's why there's no plans to resupply the secondary oxygen supply. It's going up fully charged. Right. But before we use NORS and interim NORS and Casio and whatever else puts O2 into these tanks that eventually end up in our EMU, we're going to have to be really sure that it's that it's will meet our spec. So is this, would you consider that the limiting factor in EVAs? Between now and when we get NORs, it'll be the long pole and the tent. Because we've got a plan for everything else. I mean as long as we can launch hardware, it may not be the best plan, you know, we don't have shuttle, but it is a plan that we can resupply. But if we can't resupply O2, then that really limits our EPA capability. So we won't be doing as many EDAs obviously as we would like to or as we have been in the last couple of years. Okay, next slide. And then our conclusion is kind of a takeaway. We've limited our resupply capability. Hardware becomes disposable. The crew members are going to be doing a lot more work with the hardware than they had planned on. But all of that sounds like if we go beyond low Earth orbit, or when we go beyond low Earth orbit, that's how we're going to be operating. We're not going to have resupply capability. Your hardware is going to have to last as long as possible and you're probably not going to be bringing it home. So this really prepares us for future missions. Great test bed. Before we finish, one of the things I'd like to do, we have a lot of folks in here that have worked with us, worked the EMU, worked on this project. Is there anything that you guys would like to add to add value to the information today? Ryan? As far as consumables go, you said 25 pounds for the pre-breed. That doesn't include the O2 that we use for maintenance. Right. For the EVA and for the size. You're looking at almost another 50 pounds. Yeah, yeah. That's a good point in that we use O2 not just for the pre-breed, but when we do pre-highlight maintenance on the suits we use it also so. Bill, with that in mind, I was under the impression that all systems in ISS were clinging to class 200, the EMU was clinging to class 100. Does that create a problem for you using that O2? I don't know the specifics of that. I do know that the O2 spec is not going to change for the EMU. So, if that's true, then the solution has to be found. I know that the EVA office is not going to relax the O2 spec. I didn't think so. That's what I was asking. If any of you had the opportunity to hear a lessons learned pitch by a guy named Joe Nowetner, I think he's going to do it again. He gives an excellent talk on the 1978 EMU fire in Building 7. And it shows you what Pure O2 can do quickly. Thank you all for coming if there's no other questions. Thanks."

Most recently she is in EA3, but she came from the Primal Thermal Systems Division where she got her start in lunar dust. She has got several years of experience in lunar dust and other areas with JSC. She's even had her own company and her past experience. So she has a wealth of knowledge, and she's got a lot of information on lunar dust, and has a great presentation for you today. So I'd like to go ahead and turn it over to you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for sharing your lunch hour with me. I'm glad to see the good turnout. My current position is I'm Constellation's lead for lunar regolith management and integration. So I'm responsible for developing the strategic plan and then implementing the infrastructure that goes along with it. So, you know, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it. Just a quick little bit of background. When I first started working in this area, I worked closely with Joe Cosmo and Mike Rowan and some of those guys who had kind of been around and kind of knew some of the challenges with lunar dust. And on the other hand, I was going to a lot of workshops and a lot of seminars and a lot of conferences, and I was hearing all kinds of stuff about how bad everything did with dust. And I'd come back and I would repeat some of the things that I heard, and they'd say, that's not quite exactly right. And so I started getting kind of embarrassed. So I said, I'm going to go learn the real story. And so I went and looked through all the mission debriefs and technical debriefs and mission reports from Apollo and captured lots of quotes. And those are all in the document that's listed on the slide there. what you will see today are excerpts from from that some quotes we're going to try and have a little bit of fun and hopefully be a little bit interactive here so put on your thinking caps for this next hour please okay Okay. Okay? Yep. Remind me to dust my camera too, will you? Don't forget to dust your camera. We'll keep track of that for you, Steve. So we're going back. We have the new charter. We're going back to the moon. So astronauts will work and probably play on the moon again, and they're going to be in the middle of all this dust. So our job, if we are an engineer who works on systems that are going to come into contact with lunar dust, is to think about that throughout our design. So you all have a big part of the solution to the problem. I will mention that during the Apollo program, Joe Cosmo often tells us that they didn't really think about dust. They didn't know it was going to be a problem. And then once they discovered that it was a problem, they had little bits of time in between missions to try and solve the problem, but it wasn't a big effort. So considering that there wasn't a lot of thought put into how we were going to learn to live with this dirt. Actually, they did a pretty good job. The other thought is Harrison Schmidt reviewed the report that I compiled of the quotations, and he asked me to include a quote of his, which was, a solid, structured, layered engineering defense will solve any apparent problem with lunar dust. So there's a couple of perspectives. So we're going EVA. All right. But we will at 5. Okay, that's it. You don't mind a little dirt here and there, do you, Kenny? Okay. No. No, daddummit. Well... Hey, Tim, would you go over and help sprinkle those, please, Danny? Dadgummit. Well... Hey, Tim, would you go over and help crinkle toes, please, Danny? I'm really... I tell you, you fix that camera, Bradgett, so the bag stays on and I'll be a lot better off. Sure, Roger. The last thing that Jack said is if you could design this system so that it would hold on to the bag instead of keep falling off, I would be in a lot better shape. So beyond the suit, there's also thinking about the tools and how things are carried and moved around. So I'm just going to read a few quotations here. These are about the experiments that were put out on the moon. One of the color contrast charts fell over and became covered with dust. I got back up and tried to brush it off, but it was impossible. I just made a shambles of it. The dust clung so badly that we didn't get a color shot of that. That was from Conrad in Apollo 12. An interchange from Apollo 16. A guy really can't lift his feet too high around the central station because when he does, he kicks dirt all over the passive seismic experiment. They said they were having problems with the PSE. Already, already, that's because there's dust on them. And from Schmidt in Apollo 17, as a general comment for any radiator surface that needs to be protected, you have to have more than just a cursory design on the protection for those radiators. Bob, I tell you, this central station's a bear. Bear to get levels. Well, I just got dust on it now. It's just too soft. Alcet, captain, there's dust on top of that central station sun shield. Too important. Alcet, flight. Go ahead, flight. You can see that dust on the top of the central station. Well, that computer was drilling in hard stuff because it took a lot to get it on. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the central station sun shield. We're only concerned with dust on the thermal surface on the side. The top side of the sun shield is what we're talking about? The white surface on the top of the package? That's fine. That's fine? Roger. Okay, Jack, and we can certainly stand a little bit of dust, at least on top of that central station sun shield. If you notice, things were real close to each other, and he's got this bulky suit. The visibility at that time, the visors are not what we have now so they weren't quite as good you really couldn't look down and say and so that they had to be very careful that they weren't tripping over things or knocking things over so that was that was a big part of what they were talking about as far as expending the energy and making sure that you're not knocking things over Anything else? Okay, on"

Okay, on two of the missions, the crew broke rover fenders. From Apollo 16, I think it was Station 8 where we lost the rear fender, and that was because I fell over it. Avoid those fenders if you can. Every time a wheel came off the ground and went back in and dug in, it was like we were watching rain. Dirt came over it, covered up the battery cover and the instrument panel so bad you couldn't read the power down or power up decals. And from Cernan, Apollo 17, with the loss of one of the fender extensions, any one of them, the dust is intolerable. Not just the crew gets dusty, but everything mechanical on the rover is subject to dust. I'd like to consider one other impact that you'll see in this. I don't really think it's worth it. Not bad for you being close. Can you see me, Bob? We're watching Dean right now. You disappeared on his bite a long while ago, Tina. I'm on the left corner there, Rich. Hey, it just came into sight again, Jack. Hey, leave me enough room to deploy the heat flow. I'm going to. I'm looking for a place away from craters and rocks. That's where I didn't land up there. Flight EVA. Good. Hey, CDR is 20 minutes behind at this stage. Roger. Okay, I think I got a place. And I think it'll also give you a spot for the neutron flux that's sheltered from the RTG. Okay, so you have a place like that, Jack? Well, pretty much I think, Bob. Let me work on it here a little more. Okay, and right now you're about ten minutes behind the timeline, Jack. Okay. Bob, I'm only going to spend another minute or two on the fender. We'll catch up. I never thought I'd be out here doing this. He thought I'd be out deploying the experiments. And they took a timeline hit. So things to consider. Every part of the mission, as you're thinking through your system, How does that system interact with the overall system that's going to the moon? And how can you better design your system so that you have better chances of mission success? Okay, trips, falls, and push-ups from Apollo 15. I was pulling on the lanyard with one hand and trying to take pictures with the other. Of course I fell down there once because I tripped backing up in all that soft soil. And from being Apollo 12, one thing that continually disturbed us the whole time, particularly Pete, was the fact that the TV cable was right in front of the mesa. Our TV cable laid flat on the ground. It didn't curl up or anything like that. It rests on top of the dust and your feet go beneath the dust. is just too highly traveled an area to have something like that TV cable underfoot. Yep, tell whether... Nice and cohesive, but holds a straight wall very well. Very fine powder, just like graphite. Okay. Now why don't we call that a trench. Wouldn't that be nice if you could do that at Station 8? Oh, I hope so. Okay, let me get this moved to your left. And let me get over here. A little further, Jim. Okay, troops, and we'll be asking for an SESC from the bottom of the trench when you get it built. Okay. Oh, got a handle, buddy. Yep. Just get in front of me and get your hand. Stand by. Okay. Okay, that's it. Thank you. Do you have the picture? Yeah, I think so. The rim, as all rims around are very soft. Do you really see the effect that CG is half to the high? Yeah. trying to stand straight up people fall over backwards and so anytime you make any mistake backwards would something like snow shows helped possibly soft so their boots were pretty big if you look at and they were I was just over in building seven by the way before I came over here and I was looking at the suit. Those boots were pretty big. Snowshoes maybe would be good. How about a walking stick? You know that might be something that that would help. Charlie. Way into well. Pretty hard around here. Oh, man. That's all right. I do that all the time. Usually I have my thumb in the way. Flight Science, go ahead. Looks like you hit a rock. Okay. Now we're going to have to go get the tongs. Yeah, looks like a good plan. Having a tough time with that hammer. So did they actually have a pair of tongs or pinchers that would pick up things? Okay, now the flip side of that. I told them you were. What? Okay. We see that one went all the way in. Not quite. There it is, all but about 5 inches. Okay. That one was... Okay. It's going to be different from place to place. Experiments are going to be different. They're going to be doing different kinds of activities. Maybe the systems, the EVA systems, need to be able to be more versatile. These were actually pretty versatile suits. They worked pretty well. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. They were very, very versatile. work pretty well considering what they were asked to do. Okay, EMUs. In the area where the lunar boots fitted on the suit, we wore through the outer garment and we're beginning to wear through the mylar. In one case during Apollo 12, there was actually pressure drops, and dust has taken a big claim on that. The question is if that is really the case. It may have exacerbated it, but the boot was rubbing against the fabric, and so that was probably the root cause. And then dirt got down in there, which would have made it worse. And it actually partially wore through the bladder because there was a pinhole and there were pressure drops. Evelyn Orndock has talked a little bit about the fabrics that they used to"

And it actually partially wore through the bladder because there was a pinhole and there were pressure drops. Evelyn Orndock has talked a little bit about the fabrics that they used to make the suit. And they're very abrasive by nature, the fabrics were, because we didn't want to do any forward contamination. So the fabrics themselves were abrasive. So they were abrasive material rubbing against abrasive material. And then put a little bit of dirt down in there that's abrasive too. I had some difficulty seeing my flags with the visor down. I did too. I found it was the dust accumulation. That was from Irwin and Scott, Apollo 15. And there's a lot of quotes about abrasion of the visors, of the gold visors. they would use their hand to clean off the visor and it just scratched it. And on the same vein, they told us to give a police check and I couldn't read my RCU numbers because I had made a mistake reaching up with my finger and tried to wipe off the dust. That white colored inclusion we sampled looks like a strange... Gotcha. The old boulder rolling trick. How about getting a soil sample under there? Don't hit the rover. Get that sample under there, Jack. Look at that rock. Okay. Got a bag? Got a bag. the soil from right underneath the rock down to about 4 centimeters and 505. Experiment, Sly. Go ahead. We still need one more rake sample. Get the upper. I only got one. Yes, we need a rake up the road. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. when they were doing that sampling is they turned the shovel over and poured the sample and the sample would go down the outer glove. It became a source of big contamination when they went inside. Okay, translation aids. These are references to taking the equipment and samples from the surface up the ladder to the porch. The problem is that the lower end of the strap got completely covered with dust and I got dust all over my hands and my suit arms from handling that strap. And the strap was the one that was on the lunar equipment conveyor. Again from Apollo 12, when I removed the first Lyo box on the first EVA to send it up, that one fell off and I had to pick it up out of the dirt. Once it gets in the dirt, forget it. And from Apollo 15, the connectors got covered with dust, one of mine. One of the primary problems was that the LEC on EVA 1, when I passed through the rock box on the LEC, I just got covered with dirt all down the front. The result was pretty dirty connectors. During Apollo, they found that covers, booties, worked real well to protect the connectors. Also they had over the joints, they had covers that protected the joints. So there are ways to do it and there's also the thought that you may have self-cleaning connections so that you, you know, yeah you have a positive pressure that blows out the dust or that kind of thing so that that is actually technology that's being looked at now okay we've been outside getting real dirty so now we're going IVA the place where most of that dirt came from was the strap-on pockets we had we got smart after EVA one and before we got in we closed the flap but the first time I got in with that flap open and my pocket caught on a hatch sill and when I came in with that right leg the dust flopped out. You had a pocket full, you had a contingency sample right in your pocket. The hatch was not big enough for the crew to go in and out. So that was kind of a problem in itself, but it really exacerbated the dust problem. And so this what this discussion is about. He collected, John Young collected a lot of dirt inside of his strap-on pocket and then when he climbed in, it just fell out onto the floor. From Mitchell in Apollo 14, in training we thought that removing our boots may be an unnecessary, time-consuming step and we probably sleep with the boots on, but they were so covered with crud that I did not want it sifting down in my face during sleep. We took them off.\" This is a picture that you often see of Gene Cernan and they talk about how dirty he is and you can see that his suit is pretty dirty. I want to just show you a comparison there. This picture, the second one was taken just a few moments after the first one. He's removed his EDA suit, and you can see he's got smudges up on his forehead here. And his constant wear garment is smudged with dirt. So what happened is he took off his suit and transferred that dirt to himself, and all the crews claimed that once they got that dirt on them, they could not get it off until they got home. Now, just to give a little perspective, look at where the suits are and where Gene is. Look at the proximity of him to that dirt. Plus, there's dirt all over the floor. A lot of the problems were caused by that. There were sticky mechanisms as was mentioned earlier. On our final hookup back in the LM ECS system for ascent, it was all we could do to get our wrist locks and suit hose locks to work. They obviously were beginning to bog down with dust in them. 15, the PGA connected and disconnected all right, except when we got in the dust and dirt. Then sometimes it would stick, but in general, I thought it worked great. From Apollo 16, donning was hard. I'll tell you, pulling that restraint zipper was really rough. After we got dust in the zipper, closing the zipper and locking it was pretty, pretty bad. You know, the suits are now at the Smithsonian. And Joe told me he recently went out and was taking a look at those suits and at the fittings and the connections. He says they were like brand new after they were cleaned up. So there's another thing to consider. Either you don't take those suits apart and get dirt in them or you have ways to clean them after you've taken them apart before you put them back together. Okay, we're gonna launch. Cabin atmosphere was excellent when we got back inside the first time in 1-6G. The atmosphere remained that way although we brought in quite a lot of dust. The same with the second time and the cabin j"

Either you don't take those suits apart and get dirt in them or you have ways to clean them after you've taken them apart before you put them back together. Okay, we're gonna launch. Cabin atmosphere was excellent when we got back inside the first time in 1-6G. The atmosphere remained that way although we brought in quite a lot of dust. The same with the second time and the cabin jettison pressure, depressurization. Once we got into zero G, there was a lot of dirt, dust, and debris that was floating around the cabin and we chose to remain in our suit loops as much as possible because the dirt, dust, and debris that was floating around. From Young, actually cabin depress cleaned the floor pretty good. When I opened the door, the dirt would go zip right out. From 14, we found that the brush that we had planned to use to dust off the suit was effective. It did take off the first layer of loose dust. I will say that Apollo astronauts have said that they actually didn't really brush each other off because their hands were so tired by the end of the EVA. So they would more like beat the dirt off using the brush. Prior to ascent from the lunar surface, the cabin activities included covering all holes in the lunar module floor in which dust had collected could be swept. Although considerable dust appeared in the cabin upon insertion, taping the holes definitely prevented a major dust problem in zero G. That was from Apollo 17 and they were the only mission that I saw did that. From 15, I think the jettison bags over the legs worked fairly well. I think we kept the majority of the dirt out of the cabin and kept it in the bag. They used the jettison bag. Once they got in, they pulled it up, cinched it, and then removed their suit. And that was a good way to contain some of the dirt. And from John Young, I would like to see the Velcro taken off the flight floor because it sure got dirty. The Velcro was kind of like, you know, having carpeting in your house. It's a very great place to collect dust and dirt and they were unable to remove it because they brush it and it just make it go in further. Well, when they launched all that dirt that had accumulated in the Velcro came up into the cabin. Okay, we're going back and we're going to meet up with the command module. The lunar module was filthy and it had so much dust and debris floating around in it that I took off my helmet and almost blinded myself. It was from Apollo 12. Again from Apollo 12. The transfer of equipment between both vehicles was impeded by large amounts of dust and debris in the lunar module. Therefore, the timeline became very tight in meeting the schedule for Lunar Module Jettison. From Apollo 16, we tried to vacuum the suits and some of the bags that were dirty, like the big rock bags, and found it almost totally worthless. You could do a little bit, but the best method was to take a damp towel to wipe things down. Once we opened one of the decom bags just a little bit to see what was in there, the dust just floated out, and we closed that in a hurry. From Schmidt, I think having the vacuum cleaner running in the lunar module had a lot to do with keeping the flow in the other direction, filtering out the air. They actually used the vacuum cleaner to create a very slight delta P, and it did a really good job of keeping the dirt over in the lunar module side. From Mitchell, I'd recommend that to future crews, get the suits off as soon as you can. And from the 16 mission report, the vacuum cleaner failed after becoming clogged with dust. The design of the vacuum cleaner is such that lunar dust can clog the impeller. They had a lot of problems on Apollo 16. The vacuum cleaner died, so they were unable to clean off their equipment and their suits. The cabin fan on both sides, the lunar module and the command module side, were making a lot of noise, and we shut them off. And because they had some anomalies, they decided to stay docked to the lunar module rather than jettison right away. And so there was an extended period of time of that dust coming over into the command module. Okay, we're going to come home now. This is from Apollo 12. They actually used their suit hoses with ACS for the vacuum. The dirt is so fine, I don't think the Li-O filters were taking it all out. It would pump it in the ECS system and pump it back out the hoses. This was indicated by Dick's blue suit hose, which we had tied over the left-hand side and was blowing on panel 8's circuit breaker panel. That whole thing was just one big pile of dust that was collected on the circuit breakers. Not a good thing. From 14, a lot of that dust, I believe, kind of got whipped outside when we did our dump depress. The cabin dust kind of swirled around a lot of that went out through the relief valve at some point Which might have reduced it somewhat? Apollo 12 the whole thing was a cloud of fine dust floating around in there You could see it actually floated out of the bag through the zipper From Mattingly within an hour It was very noticeable that there was a coating of dust on the instrument panels and all the surfaces you'd see little rocks floating by in front of your nose. I was surprised how rapidly that stuff had all diffused in. Again, this was Apollo 16 where they had so many issues. Again from 16, we were sitting there, and there were at least four or five pebbles and rocks that came floating by. That stuff can go through your dump valve, and if it gets lodged in there so you couldn't close it, that would be a bad thing. I know we often talk about dust in this world, and I often say dust a lot of times when I'm really meaning all of the regolith. Have to also consider the pebbles and the rocks. Okay, I was over talking to Matt Leonard the other day and talking about regolith, and he says, can we just call it dirt? There is a lot of question about what dust is and that's being better defined, but I wanted to just kind of get on my soapbox for a couple of minutes and kind of talk through this. You guys look like you're having a ball. We are. It really is fun. Now, John, look at that footprint. Look underneath that regolith. When you kick that up a centimeter or so under it, it's white. Absolutely white right here. Take your old thing and do exploratory there for a while. Let's adjust that. Look. Look at that. Come over here. Yeah,"

        "text":"Document: The_Apollo_Experience_Lessons_Learned_for_Lunar_Dust_Management_b0c02d89b2a04076aec5510cc12c1ff71d\n dust in this world, and I often say dust a lot of times when I'm really meaning all of the regolith. Have to also consider the pebbles and the rocks. Okay, I was over talking to Matt Leonard the other day and talking about regolith, and he says, can we just call it dirt? There is a lot of question about what dust is and that's being better defined, but I wanted to just kind of get on my soapbox for a couple of minutes and kind of talk through this. You guys look like you're having a ball. We are. It really is fun. Now, John, look at that footprint. Look underneath that regolith. When you kick that up a centimeter or so under it, it's white. Absolutely white right here. Take your old thing and do exploratory there for a while. Let's adjust that. Look. Look at that. Come over here. Yeah, look at that. How about doing a skim right here? Flight experience we don't want a scoop and no skim there. Okay, I guess we just like a scoop here and no skim. Okay Okay Tony, let me describe what it is. The top centimeter of the regolith is gray, and you get down under that and it's white. Alright, can we copy that? Just a bunch of different valvulamines, three shades different. Gotta be able to see that in the TV right there. Alright, we can. I'll dig you a little trench here. Yeah? Does anybody compare the composition of this stuff to volcanic ash? There's actually some simulants that were generated using volcanic ash. There's a lot of controversy in the science world about what constitutes regolith and what is dust. And because of the concerns about human health, there's been a lot of people who have said you know, the less than 10 microns, bad, bad, bad. And Wendell Mendel over in the science side, he's the constellation science person, has defined dust as the less than 10 micron fraction. And so there's a lot of attention on that 10 micron fraction. It's actually a small fraction of the overall regolith of what was returned. So I just wanted to put this in context a little bit. Whenever people talk about nanometers, I want to go see what it means. And so I found this really great example. This looks at a human hand. Here's 10 centimeters. You can see the human hand. The definition of dust is from 10 microns and lower. So basically we're looking at about right here. The smallest particles that have been found have been 50 nanometers. But those were found by putting a lot of energy into the system. In other words, I'm not even sure that we'll see those operationally. If you have to put the stuff in a sonic bath and then hold it apart with magnets in order to keep it apart, probably not going to be a concern to us. So, here's what people are focused on. 10 microns, that's about the size of a blood cell, white blood cell. 50 nanometers, you can start to see the DNA spirals. Getting down here between 100 and 10 nanometers where they're looking at the bottom of the range, you can kind of begin to see the molecules. And one nanometer, interestingly enough, is 10 hydrogen atoms lined up side by side. Just to give you an idea of what it is when people talk about the 10 micron sized stuff. The naked eye can see about 20 microns. So basically what's been defined as dust is stuff that we can't see. Here's a piece of regolith. This is an agglutinate that was found in one of the samples that was returned. I'm guessing that's probably around 500 microns. That scale there is 100 microns. So about 500 microns. That looks like it could do some damage. I mean, it looks like it could be pretty abrasive. So, the reason I bring this up is because, you know, we need to be concerned about more than what's being defined now as dust. We could see the dirt that caused a lot of our problems. If we focus on just the nanoscale dirt, we're probably going to design our systems wrong. And finally, everyone that I've talked to over in Building 31 has told me that the regolith clumps together. It's very difficult to get it to come apart and to be in its own particles. So the question of particle size distribution is very important. It's something that I'm trying to advocate to find out what we will really see in the operational environment. I'm on my crusade. You know, you're getting my soapbox here. But that's something that I think we need to do very soon. As you said, that's going to be very important to how we write our requirements, how we're going to filter systems, et cetera, et cetera. So a little perspective. We've got to deal with the bulk behavior. That's what we're going to have to manage our systems to. Thank you."

        "text":"Document: Rules_of_Thumb_for_Cost_Estimating_105d79fbe40d47a2adcbfb3a014eb0991d\nTitle: Rules of Thumb for Cost Estimating\nPresenter: Gretchen Thomas\nDate: August 2015\n Music Today we have with us Gretchen Thomas. She is a project engineer over in the thermal systems division in the spacesuit and crew survival systems branch. And she's been working for NASA for 20 years now as a project engineer and concentrating on the portable life support system, primarily for the new space suit. And her specialty is in CO2 removal, and she's been in systems analysis and thermal analysis, overseeing those projects for all those years that she's been here with NASA. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of Houston, and just recently, not too long ago, in 2000, she received her master's from the University of North Dakota. She has been working with a lot of senior engineers as well that have retired and shared their knowledge with us and lessons learned, particularly Mike Rowan. She has worked with him and he mentored her through her career. A lot of the information you're going to hear today was a lot of the information that Mike shared with Gretchen as a project engineer in her career. So this is not a cost estimating class, but a class that will be helpful hopefully for the engineer or project manager that would like to have some rules of thumbs to go about when they're managing their projects. So let's welcome Gretchen. Thank you. Thank you. All right. As Cinda said, this is not a cost estimating class. What I'm trying to do is pass along the words of wisdom that I received from my mentor and hopefully pass something useful on to you also. So this is a cost estimating knowledge capture. And the purpose of this presentation is everybody in this room is going to be asked for a cost estimate at one time or another. And so the purpose of this presentation is to kind of give you a place to start. If you've never done one before or if you've done them and you still aren't quite sure how to start them. So here's the reality of a cost estimate. A good cost estimate takes time to build, a lot of time. You can spend a couple of months on a good cost estimate for a big project. But you're never going to have that long. You probably have weeks at most for a really big project. If it's a smaller project, you're lucky if you get days or hours to pull together a cost estimate. So the shorter the time you're given to do this cost estimating, the more you're going to have to account for your uncertainties and the things that you're going to forget also. So this is giving you kind of rules of thumb. Also, the reality of the situation is that management is going to ask you for the data again and again in a different format. It may be a year later, you know, and that's what happened to us back in 2005, 2006. The constellation program was overturning and was getting new management in place. And so a cost estimate that we had done two years before, we had spent several weeks as a team putting together a cost estimate and we were asked for that same cost estimate again, but in a different format. And so, if you don't want to have to start from scratch every time, document everything that you do. Document all of your assumptions. Label your cost components well, because you're going to forget. You may think, oh, you know, this is obvious where I got this from. But when you go back a year later after totally, you know, saying cost estimating is done, I can get on with my work now, you will forget where you came up with those numbers. So please, please, please document for yourself. Okay, so here's your words of encouragement. Everything that we do at NASA, whether it's hardware or documents or mission support, is created by hourly labor of people. And the good news is you're a person. All of you are people. So you can do this. You can guess how much it's going to take to do an activity. So all you have to do is boil down all of your hardware and all of your documents and all of your reviews into the number of hours that you think it would take you. That's what I do. I sit down and think how long would it take me to do this document and use that as your guideline. So pretend you're doing the work and how long would it take you to get it done and then you should be able to roll everything up eventually. So where do you start? Getting organized is the first essential step. You have to know what you're building, if it's a piece of hardware or if it's a design review or something like that. You need to know your schedule and I'm going to talk a little bit more about this later but there's the ideal schedule if you had all the time in the world and you could follow the process exactly as it's laid out in the engineering work instruction 023 you guys should be familiar with that which is a project engineering process if you were able to do everything in an orderly fashion that's your ideal schedule and then there's going to be the dictated schedule you may say this project is going to take three years and management is going to say no, no, you have a year and a half. So take that into account in your cost estimating. Choose your method based on your data needs, how much detail the management has asked for, how close they need that estimate, you know, is plus or minus 10 or 20% good enough for right now? Are you actually getting your budget for next year or are you just trying to put placeholders in for the next five or six years? Well, if you're cost estimating something that's out five or six years, you're going to do the same exercise next year too. So maybe, you know, plus or minus 10 or 20% is good and you can fix it next year and kind of make your adjustments as you go on. And then also keep in mind that the quantity of work that's required to complete a specific required to complete a specific task or a certain job to write a document is fixed to build a piece of hardware. That's not going to change regardless of what management says your schedule really is. So what I always do is I do an ideal schedule and I lay it out exactly if I had, if I was queen for the day and I could do my project the right way and get everything done in an orderly fashion, I lay it out that way and then I adjust it to fit the situation because remember that if it takes 80 hours to do a design and you only have three days, you're going to have to pay overtime for those people. And so lay it out as your 80-hour job and then factor in three shifts of people in order to get it done faster and things like that. And again, document your assumptions. Write down everything as you go. And I'll show you a really good tool in a minute to do that. Okay, so I'm going to give you a really broad overview of cost estimating methods. And if you want to know more about them, NASA offers classes on these that are a couple days to a couple of weeks long on how to run these tools. So I'm going to talk about three different ways you can do cost estimates among a lot of others. One is a cost estimating relationship. And an example of this is the NASA"

So I'm going to talk about three different ways you can do cost estimates among a lot of others. One is a cost estimating relationship. And an example of this is the NASA Air Force cost model, NAFCOM, that you can use. And these cost-estimating relationships use a similar piece of hardware. You know, I built a pump, or the Air Force built a pump. They built a lunar lander. You may reach back all the way to Apollo to try to estimate the cost of the constellation lander. They may look back at the cost of the Apollo lander and that kind of thing. So they use big pieces of hardware and then they use cost estimating relationships like system weight. There's factors built into the tool on how much that system weighed and how much you think your system is going to weigh. And then also uncertainty factors. They can pick high, medium, low levels of uncertainty in different categories. And they apply statistical equations based on these, on the analysis of the existing database. And so this tool is very good. they spent years and years and years inputting historical programs into this tool. And so they're all there for you to reference. And there's a training class on that one. I highly recommend it. If you're going to be doing a lot of cost estimating or if you're going to be doing an important cost estimate on a big project, go take that class. Okay, there's another method called parametric cost estimating. And, again, this uses a historical database as a reference when estimating the cost of a future project. You can think back into your past engineering history and say, well, I have to build this EVA tool, and it's very similar to a tool that we built three years ago for Space Station. So I think they're going to be very close to the same, and then you can make your adjustments, you know, based off of that. But it'll get you very quickly in the ballpark. If you knew you built a similar tool for $200,000 three years ago, this one's probably going to be $200,000-ish, you know, plus or minus 20% or something like that. The disadvantage here is there's a very, very high cost-risk potential. If the actual project is sufficiently different from the one that you did in the past history, some new piece of technology came up or there was some quirky little thing in the way it was going to be operated or used that you didn't account for, then it can come back to bite you. So be very careful saying, you know, well, we built an oxygen compressor for a million dollars. This one should be a million and it turns out to be five or six because it was used in a different environment or something like that. A contact for this cost estimate, and actually all your cost estimating, Kelly Sear, he works in the, he's the guru on site, and so he's a good contact to where to get started. Okay and then the third one I'm going to talk, this is more the rest of the pitch is about this grassroots or bottoms up estimating. This is if you want like an independent cost estimate, an independent government estimate you use on procurements a lot of times. I I found this very useful and this is one that I have the most experience with. And it's based on identifying the labor hours and the materials that you require to do a project. And you build the estimate from a low level of component detail. I work on the portable life support system. So when I go to cost estimate that, I break it down into components. I know that I have to have an oxygen system, I have to have a CO2 scrubber, I have to have a pump, I have to have a fan. And so I break it down that way. And then I also roll on top of that the whole design process where we have to incorporate PDRs and CDRs and requirements review at the beginning and that kind of thing. And so I have a combination of labor estimates for tasks and component estimates for hardware. And so the advantage is this results in a really high level of visibility into your project costs. And it's also kind of structured in the way you're going to manage your project because you will probably delegate those big chunks to people. You know, you'll have a lead for your oxygen system, and they're responsible for delivering their oxygen tank and their oxygen regulator at a certain period of time. And so this cost estimate is based kind of at that kind of a breakdown so that it's very easy to allocate your resources to your different people on your team. It's, you have a lot of insight into details and so you can see if you're missing something. It might, it'll jump out at you or at a coworker looking over your shoulder and kind of helping you with your estimating. The big disadvantage on this one is you do have to have some expert knowledge about the system you're building. If you've never built a compressor before and you don't have any idea what kind of components make up a compressor, you're going to have a really hard time estimating it. You'll probably get the big project costs right, you know, the project management and the reviews and the documentation, but you're going to miss, you're going to have a big hole in your hardware costs. So if you don't have that expertise, you need to find someone who does and lean on them for that knowledge. So here's your tools. Excel is your friend. It is your biggest friend. You should build all of your cost estimates in Excel. I know Microsoft Project, you see my bullet at the bottom, has very powerful cost estimating features in it. But if you're not a Microsoft Project expert, you're going to have a real hard time with that. Excel is real easy. Everybody can put in formulas. You know, it's basic math. And it's very easy to put text in there and notes and notate your assumptions. And I'll show you some examples in a few slides so you aren't confused about what I'm talking about. So, use the formulas. Use its formula feature. I'm going to show you one example of a cost assessment I did a long time ago where I didn't put a labor rate as a global variable. I just plugged it in and I copied my formula down. Well then when I changed the labor rate, I had to go through every cell and change. So use your global formulas, your global things for multiple calculations, things that you have like overhead, even like numbers of crews, crew members, numbers of missions and that type of thing. Anything that you think is going to"

Anything that you think is going to change and is using multiple calculations. And things that are likely to change over time. Labor rates or inflation factors and that type of thing. And document your assumptions. Again, that's the third time I've said it, so it's very important. Document your assumptions, which is your basis of estimate, your rationale. Hey, I thought this was going to be like this other item that I built. And so you put a little reference in there. Similar to XXX program, project, times 10% because of complexity. And so, documents you go in the spreadsheet and the more you write the better. Even reviewing this presentation that I had actually built about a year and a half ago, and I was looking back at the examples that I used, they were very fresh at that time. And when I was going through them again in order to talk to you guys, I was having a hard time. I wish I had put more notes in so that I could remember what I had put, what I had said at that time. And keep it simple, very, very simple. Microsoft Project, I use that. I actually start usually with Microsoft Project, but as just my scheduler. I build a schedule in Microsoft Project and I keep track of all my tasks because it's very easy to see how things are laid out and interconnected. And then I use that structure in my Excel tool to start cost estimating the tasks as I go in the hardware. Okay, so organize your project. I've got two slides here that go hand in hand. This one is the EA work instruction 023 and I use that to build my schedule because it's got every milestone that you're going to be required to use at NASA to begin with. But it also, it's a good process. I mean it's one we all ought to be using, required to use, but it will account for all of your activities. And so when you put your planning, your requirements development in there, your reviews, and your hardware fidelity. You've got different cycles of hardware development and you know development unit testing, prototype testing, and that type of thing. It's all built into O23 and so use that as a resource to make sure you don't forget things. And it'll give you your your order of magnitude for your activities and it'll also kind of help you lay out your cost profile because you know when you'll get certain big cost items in your profile. Okay, and the other thing that I like to use, they also offer a class on this, a product-based work breakdown structure. There's lots and lots of different philosophies on how to do work breakdown structures, what works best, task-based or product-based. And I've had training in the product-based WBS, and I find it to be the absolute most useful for cost estimating because it's really essential for capturing all your hardware pieces because that's what we're ultimately about. We want a widget to show up on launch day certified, ready to go, ready to fly. And so it's all about what activities are required in order to get that thing to the launch pad. And so if you have this in mind, then you can break it down into its component pieces and accounting for your processes, you can tack on your design reviews and your certification activities, your testing, your life cycle testing, and that type of thing. It's also useful for capturing materials dollars, which sometimes get lost in the big process. You may have all your design accounted for, but you may not have your materials captured in there, which your product-based WBS will help you remember to capture those materials costs. And then one of the tricks that I try to do when I'm kind of getting my, you know, swag at my estimate to begin with is to try to picture the individual parts in sufficient detail. You know what a carbon dioxide scrubber looks like. You know, it's a canister and it's got a header on it and it's got some filters in it. And so, or example, I'll use my example idea here. The fan, it has rotors and housings and switches, an electrical harness, it's got a motor on it and some sensors. And so if you can picture the number of parts that you have, then you can kind of estimate the number of drawings that are associated with that. And so in order to get the drawings, that's your design effort. And I've got a rule of thumb in a few slides that will show you how to estimate those design efforts. But if you can break it down into its little component pieces, that will help you estimate your design effort. Okay, then you're ready to go. Once you've organized your project, you've got your schedule, you've got your big picture, you've got your hardware, just start cranking. Sit down at your Excel spreadsheet and just start typing in your tasks. And I've got some examples here. I'll show you what I mean. This is an estimate that I did way long time ago for my master's degree. It should come up hopefully. An Excel-based tool. And what I did here, an Excel-based tool. And what I did here, let me zoom in a little bit so that you can see. I walked through the O23 process again. I had to do my subsystem development. And so the first thing I probably typed in, if I can remember that far back, is these big headings. I had to do my architecture. I had to pick what my spacesuit architecture was going to look like. This was an estimate for a spacesuit system. And I had to do my preliminary design, my detailed design, build my prototype hardware and test it. Here's my hardware fabrication certification. And then I just started filling in, okay, in order to do system architecture, what do I have to do? First of all, I have to organize my team. And so, for example, you'll see here I said I've got seven major subsystems. I'm going to need 17 members to start off with, one person for each subsystem. I figured they were committed 30% of the time and so if you look over here into my formula you can see I've got seven people times six six weeks yeah thanks times 40 hours a week and this was my rate at that time it was $35 an hour for labor contract labor and then 30% commitment and so my note helps me explain my formula over here and so I kind of used the two hand in hand and And you"

And so you just, again, flip through, kind of break each piece down. When I'm developing my system architecture, we're going to have a series of meetings. We're going to have to have reviews. We're going to have to write documents and that type of thing. So let me click out of here and get back to my presentation. This is another type of estimate that we had done back in 2006. This was for an umbilical system for the Constellation Program. And we knew, we had identified on our team that we had to do a series of trade studies. And so we wrote down the trade studies that we knew about, and then we did detailed estimating. We knew that we were going to have to do a material survey. This particular one was a life extension trade study. How long, what type of life requirement did we want for the umbilical? And so we were going to look at COTS materials, commercial off the shelf, and see how long they last and if that was going to be a big effort. It takes people's time to go and look these documents up. You have to go to the library, you have to go on the web, you have to look at catalogs and that type of thing. Here's materials and moving parts review of the concept and so on and so forth. forth and so we captured these all here and then you can see they're all added up over here in the in the formula and then we multiplied the number of hours times the given rate that we were assuming which is up here I don't know if you guys noticed in my other one that I just showed you I didn't have the rate as a global variable but I do here and so if if we know that the engineering rate oh we missed it it's not $75 an hour it's $100 an hour so you can quick change and it immediately changes your bottom line and then let me show you one more that's a lot more complicated. This was our entire EVA system cost estimate for constellation program. Alright so this rolled up everything so we have huge amounts of data. We have all of our project management at the top but I'm going to zoom in. Don't don't stress too much about this. I'm trying to get down to our life support system. I know it was on 200 there we go. Life support system And here's our thermal subsystem. And so what we did to cost estimate our thermal subsystem, we broke it down into we knew we had to develop the heat, the primary heat rejection system. It had to be tested and analyzed. We had to look at a heat addition. It's a crew comfort heater. You had to have a transport system like a pump. analysis again, the thermal control system, the insulation, and so on and so forth. Now one thing that we did on this, we were dictated this format to use for the Excel spreadsheet. This is how the management wanted to report it up the chain. And so there was no real place to estimate your, or to document your assumptions as you went. So we put these comments in here on each cell. So you can see in the heat rejection cell, we assumed three technologies, at a low technology readiness level, right here, and we were going to spend 1.8 million dollars bringing it up to a higher TRL level the first year, and then we were going to down select and take two technologies going up to a higher level. And so I found I don't really like the comments, so I wouldn't recommend using those because they're harder to edit. Then you've got to go to edit comment, and then you've got to resize your cell, and it's never the right size. So if you're not required to use a format for reporting purposes, for your own purposes, I would recommend just making a column right beside your dollar values and putting your comments in that way. And then one thing that happened, we did have to revise this and stretch it out, and so we changed the number of technologies. At one point we went from three to two, and so we had to go and change the comment and change the formula. But it's all there, so you have your history. They're like, well, what if we down select early? What if you can't develop all three technologies, but you only have money to do one? You've got to pick your best one and go with it. So there's an example of how that works. And then, of course, it all rolled up. There's our thermal subsystem, our ventilation, and our oxygen. And then you can see it rolled up into your architecture, your systems engineering and integration estimates, and that type of thing. And this one was based on a schedule. We have our schedule up here at the top kind of guiding us on what activities were going on during that time. And again, this is an O23 compliant process. Okay? Let me close this and go back to. And again, I want to emphasize, you know, this, that gigantic Excel spreadsheet started with a team of probably about 10 of us working in a room together with a blank Excel spreadsheet. and then it was built up to that level. So you just got to start plugging away, plugging and chugging. That's all that's going to get you there eventually. Okay, so here's some rules of thumb that you can use to estimate some of your design efforts. This chart was actually given to me by Mike Rowan a long time ago. And I have since that time, in fact just recently, had this kind of validated by two very experienced designers, one at NASA and one in the oil industry. So they said, yeah, it looks about right. So this will get you at least in the ballpark. So if you know that your fan is going to require 12, you think your fan has 12 parts, And a part, a drawing for a single part is probably going to be a C size or a B size drawing. And you see the dimensions on here. So if you have 12, you know, 12 times 24 C size drawings gives you a certain number of hours. And then everything has to have an assembly drawing. And those are usually E size drawings, sometimes D, but usually E for an assembly level. And so make sure that you say, well, I may have an electrical assembly on my fan. I may have a mechanical"

So if you know that your fan is going to require 12, you think your fan has 12 parts, And a part, a drawing for a single part is probably going to be a C size or a B size drawing.

And those are usually E size drawings, sometimes D, but usually E for an assembly level. And so make sure that you say, well, I may have an electrical assembly on my fan. I may have a mechanical assembly. So there's two E-sized drawings, and then you have to have the big assembly always at the very top level. So there's probably three E-sized drawings to go along with your 12 C-sized drawings. And just do the math, and it will crank out some numbers. So a couple of words of caution on this. These estimates include the initial design and the drafting involved just to get a part to drawing release. It's not going to include your management oversight, your reviews, your safety and your quality checks, that kind of thing. So make sure you add your support people on top of this. And I usually do 10%. Now, if you have a lot of time and you have a very well-defined part, you can actually go to the manufacturing department. You can go to the safety people and say, okay, here's my list. You know, what is your estimate to review these tasks for you? But usually you don't have time to involve that many people, so you have to put just a global number on top of everything that you do. And, again, depending on what your cost estimate is going to be used for, it will probably get you close enough to get your project started. Document the components and the number of drawings that you've chosen and be very careful to document how you got that it's going to be 12 C-size drawings. You know, list out the parts. Like I said, you know, you've got a rotor drawing, you've got a motor drawing, you've got an electrical harness drawing and that type of thing. Write that in your Excel spreadsheet. Okay, here's another one on document preparation. And I have, over the years, found every once in a while we take a look back. Like last summer, our team spent an entire three months writing our element requirements document for Constellation. And huge numbers of people hours went into that document. And at the end, we had, you know, 458 pages or whatever, and we did a quick calculation. And it's consistent with this document preparation rule of thumb. It was about 8 to 10 hours per page for that document. That sounds like a lot. But what goes into this is, well let me go through it first. A simple document like a project plan which is written at a very high level or a concept of operations just to get your project kicked off and get it started. I'm not talking about the final one that's been through several revisions. But just to get you kicked off, you can estimate about four hours per page for a document. And the way that this is useful is you'll have to think, well I'm going to write a test plan. The test plan is going to be probably, you know, 10 or 15 pages. I know I'm going to have a test matrix and a test description and then I'm going to have my pretest analysis in there and some description of the hardware. It's going to be about 10 or 15 pages. You can estimate eight hours a page and that will tell you how long it's going to take you to write that test plan. And for more difficult documents like something that's analysis intensive or trade studies where you have your analysis group off running a trade study for you, and then they have to document their findings. That's more complicated, about eight hours a page. And ten hours a page for documents that require some intensive research and multiple revisions, things like statements of work for procurements, requirements documents, things that are very important to your project and require a lot of attention to detail are going to run you about ten hours a page. So what that includes is, you know, going to your historical references, reading. Last year when we did, or two years ago, we did an umbilical cost estimate. And the very first thing that I did with the person I was working with was we went to the library and we looked for the Skylab requirements document. They had an umbilical on Skylab. So we tried to find that requirements document and we tried to find Apollo requirements. The Apollo life support system had some umbilicals and so we were looking for specifications on those. We were looking for contract statements of work that were in the library. Well, you know, it takes time. You've got to make phone calls. You've got to go down to the library. You've got to get your copy. You have to read it. And that is all built into this. So it sounds like a lot, but when you actually start doing your research and doing your double checking and talking to people and making phone calls, this is about what it totals up to. It's not just sitting at the computer typing the page because that's probably, you know, a 15 minute job at most. This is all the overhead and the research that goes into it. Now this also doesn't include reviewer overhead like a tech writer who's going to who's going to review and edit your document for typos or part of management review. So you need to add, in addition to this, another 10% to 15%, depending on how many people are going to have to look at your document after you've finished reviewing it or after you've finished writing it before it's approved. Okay, here's some rules of thumb that I've built over the years. This is kind of based on my own personal experience on research, breadboard, and prototype components. A research effort, which is getting down in the basic chemistry of a material, where you're in the lab, you're mixing your chemicals, trying to invent a new material. A research effort will cost you about one person's time for three to nine months, depending on what exactly you're researching. It's usually a grad student or a principal investigator working full time on your project, or two people working full time on your project, or half time on your project. and some materials and testing for about $200,000. And depending on the complexity of what you're researching, that may be a little higher or a little lower. A breadboard component, this is kind of your first generation of a component, say a life support system component, for example. You can usually get a first generation from a blank sheet of paper where you've actually proven some feasibility along the way. For a 9- to 12-month effort, you'll have a full-time person, and you may have two or three supporting people, a technician that's going to help build"

For a 9- to 12-month effort, you'll have a full-time person, and you may have two or three supporting people, a technician that's going to help build the component, support tests, and then you'll have junior engineers. And you can do a breadboard component in approximately $300,000 to $400,000, dollars. Adjust that for difficulty and for safety. An oxygen system is going to run you a lot higher because it has to go through safety reviews and panels and a lot more effort and a lot more control on your drawings and that type of thing. And then a prototype component, it's going to be more integrated, have more configuration control than just a breadboard and it's gonna be a lot more flight-like. So it's probably about double your breadboard cost and this is just again this is just very broad based on what I've learned over the years I've probably done 18 to 20 25 breadboard prototype component type components in my career this is about what they run you in my experience on life support hardware now maybe people in other areas may have different experiences you know thermal control and that kind of thing packaging or miniaturization of the components which is where you get at the end. When you're here in the prototype stage, you're going to be worrying about actually getting more flight like and so you're going to be trying to reduce your mass of your system, get the size of it down, go get away from in the breadboard stage you may be using, you're just going to buy an off the shelf valve and plug it in. But when you're at this stage, you're going to want to do a custom design valve so that you can get your weight down. And that is just as challenging and just as costly as the basic technology that you're trying to develop. So take that into account. It may consider it kind of a separate project on its own. That's what we're doing right now in the portable life support system. I have, we have our ventilation system, our ventilation team developing components, our thermal team developing components. I also have a packaging team and that's all they do is system architecture, integration and packaging work in order to get that mass and that volume down on our total system. And it's just as costly as the other systems. This is another rule of thumb. This is a guideline that was put together by our, I work in crew and thermal systems division, and our system test branch, mail code EC4, put together this guideline for cost estimating. They put this together back in 1997. Here are our 97 costs of running different tests and chambers. Chamber A of course is the big building 32 complex, Chamber B for manned thermal vacuum testing, Chamber E is a is a the largest of the small thermal vacuum chambers where we do testing a lot and then on down into these smaller vacuum chambers and so this was just a guideline to help you get a very quick estimate of what you you're going to need to budget for your test costs. And I still use this to this day. You can see there's little scribbles in the margin. This is Mike Rowan's handwriting where I think this cost was for a one week in Chamber E thermal vacuum test in 97 was $79,000 and then it was $98,000 in 04 dollars. So we applied an inflation factor on it. And again, to get a good, a real estimate, you're going to have to go to the test group and say here is my hardware, give me a cost estimate, but this will allow you to do your budget submission at least. It will get you in the ballpark. And I use this chart about every year, and it never gets updated, but that's okay because it's still good enough. In fact, I think we checked with James Hampton, the reference on there, just last year, and he said, yeah, the numbers are still pretty good. Okay. Another thing you need to remember is your margin on your projects. You are going to forget something. You'll probably forget something big. And your project is also, if it's a development project, it will encounter problems that require rework. So you just better plan on that. In fact, you can build it in. If you build in a design iteration, it kind of covers the same thing, but you still need to account for your margin. Typically, project margins are 10 to 20 percent. we all know that however if you put margin at the top line of your project you're just begging for management to come in and can't and cut it because they'll see a line that says margin 20% or 10% and it'll be I don't know a million dollars they'll be like okay out you don't need that so if you're gonna put it in you better hide it and I also don't recommend that you put it at the very can we quote you on that yeah absolutely absolutely in fact we have a one of our very very senior people in the EBA world is Joe Joe McMahon and he teaches a class now he's retired but he tells all of us told us for real in the real world he said you better have margin in your project cost and I better not be able to find it so he encouraged us yeah so but what I like to to do is, you know, you can't really justify saying, well, I have 15% margin on my project. But what you can justify is if you put your margins at the individual project phases, sub-phases, or at your specific hardware line items. Like if you say, I know that this is a risky piece of technology, I want to put 20% margin on it, that's a lot easier to defend than 20% at the top line. Also, it can help you avoid applying that global figure to things to things like project management. Project management is very low risk, so your margin is going to be small, if not zero, on your project management type tasks. Yes, you have a question? Not really a question, it's the comment on the gentleman. I thought he also said building margin on your performance of whatever it is and hide that as well. Yes, he does. Because if they discovered earlier they'll want that stripped out, that's not according requirements, but years later they will come back and ask for margin on performance and expect it to be there. Yeah, that's exactly right. Yeah, good. Damned if we do it, damned if we don't. Right. So, put it in there and hide it. So, and then things that are well known, like a well-known technology that's maybe"

        "text":"Document: Rules_of_Thumb_for_Cost_Estimating_105d79fbe40d47a2adcbfb3a014eb0991d\n than 20% at the top line.

So, and then things that are well known, like a well-known technology that's maybe just re-engineering something commercial off the shelf so that it's good for NASA's use, very small margin, five to ten percent, but if it's a really high-risk technology, a new piece of component, a new piece of life support equipment you've never built before, you're starting at a very low technology readiness level, put some margin there and that's a lot more defensible again than just putting it at the top. Okay, here's some other resources that you can use when you're doing your cost estimating. Your past projects have a similar nature. So the longer you work out here, the more you will have worked on something that's very much like what you're working on now because you're building your technical expertise. Those projects will fall in your lap. If you're a thermal expert, you're going to get more thermal projects. These are two specific projects that I had worked on. The MEDOX was a CO2 scrubber canister, and it had two major components, a static canister that scrubbed the CO2 and a regenerator oven to regenerate the canister between EVAs. And those two major components together, it was a $15 million program from day one where we started with just a prototype from all of our research and technology development we had done. And we launched into the flight design, flight certification was about $15 million. The ORCA is an oxygen compressor for a space station. It was one major power component and it turned out to be $11 million near the end. And so, you know, they're kind of on the same order of magnitude. And the compressor and the regenerator were about the same level of complexity. So, you know, it's a good gauge. We had, I've had numerous technology contracts, like I said, over my entire career. And they range anywhere from $150,000 maybe for like a pump design, a pretty simple water system. Pumps are easily understood and so maybe we're just trying to tweak the efficiency on them. All the way up to million dollar efforts on oxygen systems. If you're going to do an oxygen tank or an oxygen regulator design, you can expect to pay a lot more money, even at a development level for technology. Ask your coworkers for their experiences. If you knew that, you know, Mike Rowan worked on the Skylab umbilical, ask him for, he's probably got a whole file cabinet full of those documents that he saved over the years. So ask him. Get him to dig that stuff out for you. And I highly recommend estimating in teams of two, and only two. If you're by yourself, you're going to miss a lot. You're going to forget a lot. You're going to get sidetracked. going to get kind of focused in on one area and forget another area. You may be totally focused on your hardware components and you're going to forget all of the management overhead that goes along with it, design reviews and that type of thing. So you mean on that one, have more than one person look at the estimate? I mean build the estimate. Build the estimate, excuse me. Yeah, I mean. More than one set of eyes. Yes, more than one set of eyes. You sit side by side. You know, if it's a small project, you probably don't have that luxury. But if it's a big project, you know, sit at the same computer and sit there and talk about it, talk things through. And I would do more than two by exception. The reason is it slows you down. It's a lot harder to cost estimate in a group. We did it a couple of years ago and we had like ten people in the room and we had the Excel spreadsheet projected up on a screen and it's just so tedious and it takes so long to get anywhere and you have to wait for people to type. Too many cooks. Too many cooks, too many cooks. So two is good because you've got to have more than one, but I don't think you need more than two. And then you're going to have reviews, so you're going to go over the data with other people as well, so they'll get their input. And I don't mean you have to build the entire thing yourself. Like you could split it up, send the thermal subsystem over to the thermal guys and let them do it and then bring their numbers back, that type of thing. NASA does have a cost estimating website, great resource for you. Hopefully this will find it. There's your link. All kinds of tools in here. There's inflation calculators. There's links to the training modules. There's all kinds of papers that you can read. Here's the databases. There's NAFCOM database and so on and so forth. So you can spend a lot of time exploring this website. And you see down here that Kelly Sear is in charge of that. I missed the other thing. So really, really good resource for you to use. I highly recommend you keep that link. It's real easy. Costs.jsc.msc.gov. And then rely on your budget analyst. They'll give you access to current labor rates for contractors. They can give you your overhead rates for the different divisions and organizations around NASA. Each center has their own overhead rate, their tax that they put on all the project costs and that type of thing. They give you civil service rates and stuff like that. So rely on those people as well. And it's anybody in your, you know, if you don't know how to find them, ask or go to your division website and look for the person with the L mail code and that that's your budget analyst and get to know them very well. Okay so a couple of things to not forget. Here's some miscellaneous and often missed categories that I found over the years. Procurement activities. Procurement always, always takes longer than we plan and we don't give it enough attention. In engineering I don't know how many of you guys are our engineering or operations but we never allow enough time and if we start if we ever started allowing enough time and enough schedule enough budget to do the procurement startup the procurement people would be very happy with us we have much better relationships going on a small procurement can take you three months large procurements can take you a year to a year and a half for a big big system but I generally we plan three to six months depending on how complex your procurement is and if you don't plan that"

My team is getting ready for a design review on Monday and Tuesday of next week and I think probably 20 people on my team have been doing nothing but writing the final report and preparing charts for the last two weeks. They have not been doing analysis and design work so they've been documenting their progress so make sure you account for that. That adds up plus the cost of the review itself. If it's a major review and you've got a lot of participants and it's a week long, like some of your flight hardware systems will have week long reviews at the end. Especially if it's a life support system, you know, high criticality type system. Your paperwork closure, do not underestimate this. It takes a long time, especially if you have a lot of reads on your system at your design reviews. It's going to take, you know, one person full time for a couple of months to close all your your RID items if not more than that. On your team startup and education especially if it's a brand new startup project you don't have a team already up and running you need to allow two to three months minimum until you get full productivity out of your team because if you get a project turned on tomorrow chances are it doesn't always happen you know things like tile repair happened a lot quicker but if you've just got a normal run-of-the-mill project, you're not going to get the ace people on your project and you may even have to have the contractor may actually have to go out and scour resumes and hire people off the street for your project to support you. So you need to allow two to three months for that. Even if they're already hired, they may have to transition off of their existing project and so you're not going to get them full-time and you're not going to get full speed ahead for a couple of months so make sure you put some runway in. Test build up, even mature facilities that are built at NASA for 40 years, that facility has been sitting on that block of concrete, it's going to need calibration and it will need modifications for your test because every single test has a different setup. Even if it's only moving a plumbing line or moving a, adding a couple of extra instruments because it's set up to have 10 thermocouples and you need 20. So you got to add 10 extra thermocouples plus the electrical channels plus the data acquisition. So allow for some test buildup. And then shipment and stowage of flight items. This is a high dollar item when you're dealing with flight because everything in flight has to be so critically controlled and has all the paperwork that goes along with it. You're going to be in big trouble if you didn't allow, you know, $10,000 or $20,000 to ship that piece of hardware and have it go through the paperwork process. So make sure you allow for your shipment and stowage costs. All right, any questions? Any more questions? Okay, go ahead. Do you have any similar type information for software projects? Because you seem very experienced in hardware. I have to be a software manager. Yeah. I don't. I'm sorry. I have no experience in software process submitting at all. So I'm sorry. Are there any rules of thumb for flight versus non-flight? Does flight add a certain percentage to? I don't have any. No. No. So other than when we start, well, I can only escalate what I know from my early development projects and then I know based on what my first round cost, my flight project. So if you already have a prototype built and say it costs you half a million dollars to build your prototype, you know, your flight system, I don't know, depending on what it is, it's going to be at least double. I'm talking more ground support versus actual flight certified. No. I'm sure there are. We'll have to do a survey out there and see if there's other people who have experience with that. But I don't because I don't do GSD. I just do technology development mostly and some flight hardware. Yes? You outlined three different methods for cost estimating the NAVCOM parametric and bottoms up. It seemed to me that if you had enough time and you had the available expertise, the bottoms-up would be the best way to go. Is that true? Yes. But on projects in the past where I've had enough time, we've done a bottoms-up and used one of the models as a sanity check. because they should be fairly close to each other and if they're not then something's wrong with your estimate. So it's good to get multiple versions and if you if you go to the cost estimating group the budget analysts and ask for their help at a minimum you're going to have to come in with a list basic list of hardware and schedule so you're going to have the kind of the basics down anyway and it's good to do it as both methods. Two or three methods. If you have a NAFCOM trained person in your group, have them do that. Have the budget analysts come in and help you with a parametric cost estimating and then while your group does the bottoms up grassroots. If it's a big project, I wouldn't recommend that for little projects, which you probably wouldn't be using like NAFCOM on a little project anyway. But big things like our whole EBA system you can definitely in fact management's probably going to demand it because they're going to say okay that's your great your grassroots estimate is fine but I need an independent assessment as well so big stuff yeah take the time to do it and allow a couple of months for that are there any other websites or software tools that you might want to"

You can Google anything now. Cost estimating. Probably you can't even get it for aerospace contracts. Is there any other questions? Well, glad to have you here today and thank Rafa. contract.

Good morning. Hi, my name is Cinda Tullen and I'm the Knowledge Capture Manager for our Spacesuit Knowledge Capture Program. And I welcome you all here today for this great opportunity. I'd like to introduce you to Jim McBaron. McBaron, yeah. Yes. And he's a wonderful knowledge of history of the spacesuit. I'd like to say a few things about him before we get started today. I just have to tell you, I wish that I had had the opportunity to work with Jim when he was a branch chief over in the suit branch. I just came on to work in the suits about six years ago, and I just never got the opportunity to work for you and I just wish I would have. If you think about someone who is knowledgeable about the spacesuits, it's Jim. All the way from the beginning of Mercury to the constellation of suits. Literally, he's worked every program that we had a suit for for that program. He started his, he has a Bachelor's of Science degree in Theology from the University of Dayton in Ohio. And at the time, Jim was at the University of Dayton. Langley was doing some research on human endurance. And Jim got the wonderful opportunity to be a test subject in some of the early studies for human endurance, which is unprecedented. We really don't, really have not had anyone work in the space suit that has that background. He's even told me he's even with some of the, did some of the first tests on CO2 removal technologies at vacuum, and some of that stuff has never been documented. So I'm eager to talk to him further about that topic because that's one of my interests. But it doesn't stop there. Jim got recruited by the Space Task Group after all of his testing as a test subject with NASA, and he graciously agreed to come work for NASA. And the spacesuit work that he's done really speaks for itself. He was test subject. He was a subsystem manager for the EVA work. He was a chief engineer for all the EVA projects over his career, branch chief, you name it. He's done everything from test subject to project lead to chief engineer to manager. He's done every task he could do associated with the spacesuit. And so I am thrilled to have Jim here today. He retired from NASA in nearly 40 years of service with NASA, and he went on to work for ILC and did consulting work associated with the spacesuit, as a lot of you may know. and then once he left ILC he went on to start his own consulting firm and as we speak he's in the process of writing a book about the spaces of himself. Without further ado, give me a hand. Welcome, Jim McNair. Thank you, Sandra. I just hope some of the other people that work for me would want to come back to work for me. I'm not so sure. I work them pretty hard at times. But anyway, it's my privilege to be here in preparing the last briefing and this particular briefing. I must admit I've learned things that I didn't know previously by going through some of the original materials. I have paid careful attention in making sure that the data I present and the knowledge I give to you is based on first-person accuracy, that is official NASA reports or meetings that I know I attended, and I'm not using reports and data that other people put out on spacesuits because they contain a lot of inaccuracies I've learned. So to go ahead and give you a little insight into what I'm going to talk about, At the first part of the Gemini program, there was an advanced spacesuit technology activity. Three contractors were solicited by NASA to provide suits, and those were the GX series that you see here. I'll discuss those activities. Then there was a selection activity for picking the suit that ended up flying on the Gemini missions. I'll get into an overview of the requirements for the Gemini suit in terms of mission, environment, and some of the design features. And then there was a series of different Gemini suits that I'll discuss, the G1C, the G4C, and even the G5C that flew on one of the missions. I have a summary chart of what missions what suit supported, and then I got a little chart lessons learned from my experience that I'd like to share with you and maybe you can take home with you. A little bit about spacesuit notation that may have some of you may not be aware of that was derived from my boss Charlie Lutz back in 1962 that is the first letter in the nomenclature for suit stands for the program that was going to support whether it be Mercury Gemini Apollo then And the letter X next to that letter would designate that it was for an experimental use as a prototype. And then to the left of the hyphen gives you the sequence number, like 1, 2, 3, 4. And following that is the manufacturer's name, whether it be Arrowhead, Clark, Goodrich, or Latex. And then there's some examples of that because it can get very confusing when you talk about to GXC series suits because there was quite a few different models. As I mentioned, there were three contracts awarded. This NASA put on an RFP, request for proposal, back in September of 61, 62, I'm sorry, 62, which was prior to John Glenn's Mercury flight. And NASA was soliciting inputs from industry on spacesuit technology that would be used to support future NASA missions, which at the time included the MA-10 extended life Mercury flight that I talked about last time when you were here, if you made it, as well as for the Gemini program. David Clark was solicited and declined to participate because they felt they had a moral obligation not to since they were working with the Air Force on a similar suit for the dinosaur manned orbiting project that the Air Force had. The RFP requirements called for a full-pressure anthropomorphic suit for Earth orbital missions and this is the prototype of a suit that was in the Goodrich RFP and And I'll show you some of the features. They had a hard helmet similar to the Mercury helmet, a mechanical advisor visor closure, a horseshoe collar type entry closure, pressure sealing entry closure, a ventilation inlet fitting and the outlet was on the helmet. improved arm and gloves and with adjustable cord and buckle take-ups for sizing, a life preserver pocket because we've had a requirement for a life preserver, altimeter, blood pressure cuff, tap port, and a neck dam. When you took the helmet off, you could seal the suit in the event of water immersion at the end of a mission. This was sort of like a Mercury, an improved Mercury suit, and in fact it was. It was generated design-wise to be an improved Mercury suit for potential MA-10 and subsequent missions as part of the Mercury one-day mission extension program. As I mentioned last time, this program ended up being canceled. So this suit was then oriented towards a program where we had a 14-day mission, and a pressurized 4-hour duration. This is a prototype that came from this activity, the GX-1C suit, delivered in early 1962. It had a modified"

As I mentioned last time, this program ended up being canceled. So this suit was then oriented towards a program where we had a 14-day mission, and a pressurized 4-hour duration. This is a prototype that came from this activity, the GX-1C suit, delivered in early 1962. It had a modified mercury helmet, mechanical visor seal in the items you see here. It even had bone conduction microphones and earphones that NASA was interested in evaluating at the time, which did not work out too well, by the way. nylon restraint, neoprene bladder, crisscross sliding cable shoulders, which was a new Goodrich feature in pressure suits, and you can't see them too well here, but they were used for shoulder mobility. They had a mercury suit neck bearing with an improved seal and a more positive connector locks. The conventional or horseshoe pressure ceiling entry, Mercury helmet tie-downs, and stretched fabric knees and so on. With a glove disconnect, it was one and a half inch closer to the elbow than a Mercury suit. That's so the gloves could be taken off and you'd have more arm exposed. It had an overall reflective aluminized cover on the suit. That was the GX-1C at initial delivery. After delivery to NASA it was evaluated and then modified with the changes shown here. And on the torso, the neck dam was modified with a proprietary Goodrich molded urethane material instead of rubber. Improved shoulder cable construction to increase the shoulder mobility. relax position was incorporated in one arm. We lengthened the arm by an inch and added a waistband to the waist section to try and get more waist mobility. Thumb loops on our bent tubes to make it easier to don. Boots with increased mobility than what we had in Mercury with improved foot ventilation for the 14 day mission requirement. Block and tackle helmet tie down for adjusting the helmet in a pressurized condition and of course the gloves were shortened and lacing added and snaps on the gloves. These pictures aren't too good, they're from the BFGoodrich final report for this effort. There are no known photographs that I'm aware of this suit, if so I would have had them because we went to the NASA image library and looked for them and couldn't find any. So you take what you can get, so to speak. The second suit delivered in October. The helmet was changed to a soft suit helmet and with an integral clear fixed visor. Pressure sealing closure on the helmet went from side to side around the side of the helmet. Against a clear visor that was added to prevent wind blast and was snapped in place to prevent removal during excessive wind forces. Rigid fiberglass base ring that attached the soft fabric to the neck ring. Separately wired microphones, earphones with a breakaway disconnect, Dynamax bone conduction microphones which work fairly well, and Beltone custom molded earplugs which was another attempt to see if there's a better way to get communications in the helmet. Again, aluminized mylar cover layer. This time the pressure sealing closure went down the back through the crotch and up the navel as you see here. This particular one was across the side of the helmet, both pressure sealing, integrated boots, and mobility by convolutes, BFGoodrich type comm fabric convolutes in the elbows and knees. The next suit was the second suit of the GX2G series, which you see here, was still using the crisscross nylon cord with Teblon tubes instead of metal cables. A combination sliding water check valve inlet and outlet fitting that was mounted higher up on the chest than the previous GX1G. This was the first composite suit disconnect that I'm aware of where you combine the inlet and outlet in one connector, similar that's used on the shuttle EMU today. Mechanical tie-down 32 pin connector for Biomed and Com, manifold ventilation system inside with soft ventilation tubes, relief valve, pressure indicator, gloves with wrist bearings, no disconnects. That is the fact that the disconnect was, this was a long arm disconnect that was located up on the arm and not on a glove. So the gloves were permanently worn. Pressure sealing closure to extend in harms outside of the arms. That is, you opened a zipper to get your hand out of the arm and no disconnect to take the glove off. Lower leg pocket to extend for flotation on a lower leg, as the RFP showed. Spray bar on the head since you needed a way to get ventilation up onto the head. And a drosting activated neck dam for the event of entry into water. Gloves were similar to the G1G which I'll describe in a minute. And underwear similar to what we used in Mercury with a trilock vent spacer and arms. The gloves were not going to come off for 14 days? No. They came off when you took your hand out of the arms. Did you get that straight? There was a pressure sealing zipper in the arm. You opened that up and you could pull your arm out and put it outside with the gloves remaining on the lower arm of the suit. It was just an approach that was tried. It didn't work out too well, as you'll see. The heavy wrist joint, you just pull your hand out of the glove. Right. Just pull your hand out of the glove. Now, Goodrich also in their proposals suggested a partial wear quick assembly suit prototype shown here for maximum long-term wear. Again, they had a soft fabric helmet in the RFP and an arm disconnect here way up on the arm and this is the suit that I just showed to you, just explained to you. exhaust was way down on a lower leg rather than being up on the chest where the inlet was. Wrist bearing for the gloves, soles integral part of the lower legs so the boots could not be removed but they were soft fabric for comfort for this mission requirement here. This is that suit in its configuration with the soft fabric helmet with the pressure sealing slide fastener, the horseshoe pressure sealing closure, new fancy gloves, a wrist disconnect, and the pleated neck, elbows, and arms. All of that shown here. Inside the helmet was a soft fabric cloth that supported the microphones, which were bone conduction. Both receivers located behind the ears with electrical leads connected inside the torso by a connector to the electrical line. And on the outside was a crash protective helmet shell to provide helmet protection in the event of ejection, which was the first time we were looking at the ejection seat capability that Gemini was developing, which consisted of two fiberglass hard shells that had to be connected and held in place with Velcro. The suit after delivery and evaluated in crew systems, it was re-delivered with these changes. NASA asked for a smaller size helmet. And on the torso, shoulder bearings"

The suit after delivery and evaluated in crew systems, it was re-delivered with these changes. NASA asked for a smaller size helmet. And on the torso, shoulder bearings replaced the criss-cross shoulder cables for mobility. This is the first attempt by Goodrich to look at shoulder bearings. And the circumvential pressure ceiling entry closure, which they really liked, shown here. Neck dam was deleted. vent sleeves were in a vent system with metal sleeves because fiberglass ones failed frequently, you know, just breaking. And in the left gauze sitting raised upwards on the torso three inches as shown here. This was the G1 G suit. Next suit was the G2 G1 configuration and this was that delivery. Aluminized mylar again, fabric restraint outer layer. And the reason that And an aluminized mine iron was considered was for the thermal protection in the event of ejection. The Gemini capsule was launched by a Titan II rocket using hypergolic fuels. In the event of an explosion off the pad, the crew member would be exposed to very high temperature conditions and it was felt necessary to have an aluminized thermal protection cover on the suit for that protection. The closure was down the back again and up the crotch. Helmet attached by a neck ring bearing with self-donning features. We're back to a hard type helmet. Snap together arm bearing disconnects and leg disconnects. These are first attempt at self donning and doffing glove disconnects. Convolute elbows and knees with the luminized covers again. The criss cross shoulder covers for shoulders and hips. Weak take up bladder along both sides. There was a tube, a Teflon tube along both sides of the rear entry closure to, when tied with the front helmet tie down system, allowed for improved waist mobility in a seated position. This was not a walking suit, this was a stay in the seat suit in Gemini. Fabric boots with lacings down the summer front closure. Separate down ventilation garment. Inlet connector with the sliding check valve on the front outlet. And here we separated the two connectors because of the mass and weight on the chest of a composite disconnect that was designed at that point in time. In addition, it had a 32-pin connector again, a relief valve on the left leg, and a pressure gauge on the arm. That was the development suits from B.F. Goodrich at the time, both the advanced suit and the partial wear suit. As I recall, the advanced suit was developed for the Mercury MA-10 and follow-on program, whereas the partial wear was specifically oriented to a 14-day Gemini program. This is the Arrowhead Incorporated suit. You can see the type of closure here. I don't know if you recognize this guy. This is Harold Battaglia. You may have heard of him when he worked for NASA in, I think, the Reliability or Safety Office. And then here's the suit side view with the helmet hinged on the back of the neck ring. Here's with the helmet donned, and this is a rear view. This suit was not selected during evaluation for any further work due to the bulkiness, the discomfort of wear, a lot of component failures, especially the closure entry approach put a lot of stress on parts of the closure and some of the features that held the suit together and poor workmanship. Now it was at about this point in time that the Apollo suit program was getting started and they put out an RFP and one of the companies that proposed a suit for that was the David Clark Company and their proposal was not accepted they were not selected for the Apollo suit but in their proposal they had a unique type of new concept pressure ceiling slide fastener that NASA was interested in so NASA through an RFP process to Clark Clark wanted them to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of this new pressure ceiling slide fastener for use in pressure suits and spacesuits and other applications where you need a pressure ceiling fastener. To demonstrate the adequacy of this closure, NASA wanted Clark to provide a suit which which was a modified AP-22S-2 Air Force pressure suit that was flying in light aircraft at the time, modified to meet the Gemini features that was in the Gemini program, advanced program, and the good features of the suits from Goodrich and Arrowhead and protection, which I'll get into next. So just recall there was an ongoing David Clark suit activity at this point in time in parallel. It started in parallel to this activity. The final company that provided a suit, Protection Incorporated, provided one prototype. And it was a monstrosity, to say the words. My boss said don't take any pictures of it and if you have any destroy them. It was so bad when you pressurize it, it took a contorted shape. But you got to recall NASA at this point in time had put out three contracts with the best people in industry that we could get. Protection did make suits for in vacuum test chambers in industry. so they were illogical. So did Arrowhead and of course BF Goodrich made the Merker suit so that's where we stood at this point in time. Well lo and behold the David Clark Company requested evaluation of their 951 suit which was what they called the suit that shown here which was a suit that was to be used to evaluate this new pressure ceiling slide faster concept. This concept wouldn't go along too well at this point in time and it was delayed by I think about six or eight months. So they asked to have NASA evaluate this suit because they knew that we were about finalizing the Gemini suit program and concept. So in February of 1963, Gus Grissom and I flew up to David Clark and he flew jet, of course I went commercial, and evaluated this suit at Clark and he liked the suit. And so with some emphasis on a few changes Clark delivered that suit later that month to crew systems and in crew systems division we evaluated it for weight, pressure drop, different things that we looked at on a suit including a evaluation of Gus Grissom and the crew system division Gemini mock-up that we had in the old Lane Wells building if you're familiar with where we worked in crew systems before the center was established on Wayside Drive. And this suit was submitted and with the Goodrich G2G prototype that NASA was working on at the time for the Gemini program, conducted a review at McDonald Aircraft. That was in the spring of 62. And three astronauts, Gism, Young, and Elliott performed an evaluation. And they came to the conclusion that the Clark suit was very much more comfortable than the Goodrich suit with all of its cables and hard points. And although the Goodrich suit had a better helmet than"

And three astronauts, Gism, Young, and Elliott performed an evaluation. And they came to the conclusion that the Clark suit was very much more comfortable than the Goodrich suit with all of its cables and hard points. And although the Goodrich suit had a better helmet than the Clark suit, it had better downward vision and the Clark suit helmet still had a pneumatic visor seal and the high-pressure gas to inflate that seal came from a high-pressure bottle that was molded and fit in the inside of the helmet which we didn't particularly like. Okay, anyway the Gemini program office said we want to use a G1C suit, which is shown here, which was the G2C-8 with one of the guys I worked for, Hank Frullo, in the suit here. And this was the evaluation at McDonnell Douglas with Grissom in the suit. And somewhere in that group there's Reg Machel, I don't remember Reg, and Bob Frost, Jim Shiles rather, Bob Frost, Hilary Ray, some of the people that that worked in the Gemini project office who witnessed the evaluation firsthand that came back with their recommendations. Excuse me. Yes. Didn't you say earlier that one of those companies had declined to respond? David Clark. Okay, so at some point you're not probably missing that. Okay, David Clark, when the original RFP went out for advanced technology work, three companies provided a response. They were Goodrich Protection and Arrowhead. David Clark declined to participate in that proposal, they said, on moral grounds, because they were working for the Air Force on a dinosaur project suit. Well, by this time, the Air Force canceled dinosaur. I failed to mention that. So my boss at the time was Charlie Lutz, and he was the Air Force pressure suit project officer before he came to work for NASA. And he knew all about the Clark suit because that's the suit that the Air Force used for all their fighter aircraft and high-pressure aircraft applications from X-15, the Air Defense Command, and the U-2, even were made by David Clark. So he gave David Clark another opportunity to get involved when they asked to participate. And the avenue for his getting in to Clark to participate was their proposal that was declined for the Apollo suit. It was found unsatisfactory, except for the closure part of it. And he wanted that closure to be evaluated, evaluated in a Clark suit. and a Clark suit was to be made with the latest Gemini requirements and features from the best features from the advanced suit program that was ongoing at that time. I got that straight for you? It's confusing. This is a very confusing story, I know. So basically he gave them an actual leg up to get back in by giving them what the other three companies had kind of sort of figured out and been evaluated against. And he said this is your guidelines to get in. Correct. In a statement of work, sole source, based on this closure. Yeah, it was nominally to evaluate the closure. It was to nominally evaluate the closure, but the closure, in the end, it didn't work, to be honest. You know, it never did work, but that was their avenue. Now, to get back to Goodrich, September of 1962, before the evaluation, their contract got changed to actually do the general support development, Confidential security was added to the Gemini suit because the Gemini suit development technical design was considered confidential at the time. The project was in a state of flux at that point in time and prototype suits and hardware was designed, modified, retested, redelivered, modified. NASA couldn't make up its mind what the requirements were was the bottom line. It was a problem. So, in December of 62, the contract was amended. We added 14 suits, G2C to it, five of which were completed at the design freeze to incorporate results of testing at that point in time. The removable boots and gloves that I mentioned in the previous prototype were deleted as were the removable gloves and wrist disconnects incorporated. So we got back to a standard type suit development. The activity was not to give Clark a leg up, but to do the best with any contractor source that we could get. This suit ended up being the G26, which again was evaluated, a few more changes were incorporated, and this was the suit that was delivered and used for the competition that was held that I mentioned a few minutes ago. The rest of these suits that were of the 14 were completed and delivered and the inventory supported early Gemini project needs. That is, since the Clark suit and Gemini suit had very similar weights, pressure drop, ventilation system characteristics, two of the suits were sent to air research for ECS testing. doing the environmental control system in a Gemini spacecraft. Two suits went to McDonnell Douglas for capsule mock-up evaluations for displays and controls, layout and position and type. Four went to El Centro, California, where we did parachute harness qualification testing with live Air Force subjects demonstrating the Gemini suit-parachute combination compatibility for jumps from high flying aircraft and two were sent to El Centro, I mean to China Lake for simulated off the pad ejection testing where they were mounted on a sled and the sled went down a track at the speed that a crew member would be in a seat at ejection and then ejected out of the capsule. So those were a destructive test on a suit at the start. We lost several suits. The bottom line of that contract was they ended up with a final report in February of 65, and that's where I obtained some of the photographs that I showed to you previously. Jim, you said those were destructive. Was the suit destroyed by something that went wrong with the test, or was the test correct and the suit just wrong? It was a failure of the ejection system adequacy, and the parachute didn't work. And the suits ended up hitting the ground and being dragged across the desert and destroyed, so to speak. I've got some pictures of that, but I didn't include them here because this picture is so long. But they're available if anybody should want to see them. Now to get to the real Gemini program, after having gone through the development activity with the different contractors and a selection of the David Clark suit. By the way, when the Clark suit was selected, it was selected based on using the Goodrich helmet in lieu of the Clark helmet because NASA didn't like the idea of having high pressure gas inside the helmet with the crew member. And the astronauts liked that helmet because it had better downward visibility. In addition, the Clark gloves were not up to the adequacy as were the Goodrich gloves, so the Goodrich gloves were selected to be the baseline for the Gemini suit. These were the design features. It would be an"

By the way, when the Clark suit was selected, it was selected based on using the Goodrich helmet in lieu of the Clark helmet because NASA didn't like the idea of having high pressure gas inside the helmet with the crew member. And the astronauts liked that helmet because it had better downward visibility. In addition, the Clark gloves were not up to the adequacy as were the Goodrich gloves, so the Goodrich gloves were selected to be the baseline for the Gemini suit. These were the design features. It would be an anthropomorphic full-pressure suit, 14-day mission, as I mentioned. We wanted high system reliability, maximum muff mobility and comfort, you know, all the typical things you'd want in a suit, and, of course, ejection system capability. with self-donning helmet and gloves inside the capsule, low torque, low leakage helmet and glove bearing disconnects, helmet and glove disconnects with integrated ventilation channels, that's a new concept I'll show you later, combined common biometallurgical connector, that 31 pin connector, low ventilation flow resistance, That was to be compatible with the Gemini ECS system ventilation flow. Self-sealing torso inlet and outlet exhaust disconnects so that in the event of water immersion, the connectors would be closed. One of the lessons learned from Mercury. Boot heel plate compatible with ejection seat foot stirrups. All hardware to be flange mounted for easily removing and replacing for maintenance and repair. removable outer cover layer not integrated with the different parts of the suit but worn completely around the outside of the suit to simplify cleaning and to allow structural inspection of the zipper restraint layer and gas bladder. These were the features that NASA felt at the time was required for a Gemini suit. So NASA modified this contract which was the one that they originally had for the pressure sealing flights after development to provide 14 suits of the G1C variety which included a BFG Goodrich, BFG helmet, neck ring bearing disconnect, neck ring modified helmet tie-down, which felt the best. I didn't mention previously but during the Apollo program ILC had developed some glove disconnects and bearings and in particular the glove the torso bearing on the arm was sought to be the best configuration for an arm bearing disconnect with BFG pressure suit gloves. Comp connector positive lock 30 pin connector and here's the first place where we've introduced a red color into the suit system, blood pressure system for blood pressure cuff that the medics wanted blood pressure measurements during launch. Eventually it became important. It was sort of, I don't know why they picked the red color here but NASA liked it at the time because it ended up being the color chosen for the disconnects on the arms red on one side and blue on the other which will match the blue inlet and a red outlet so that when the crew member had the gloves removed still connected with the red and blue he knew what side of arm to attach the glove to because he had a matching color on the glove to the What did they do before that? Were they just all black or silver? They were just anodized aluminum, clear anodized aluminum. Jim, question? Sure. How did you get the contractors, did you direct them to work together to share this? Okay. Obviously, Biff Goodrich was not happy with the selection of the G1C suit, But they went along with the fact that they were going to get business by providing helmets and gloves for the program and NASA said this is the way it's going to be you know Be a good rich would provide the helmets they would manufacture deliver provide the helmets then that's the for use on Clark torso as well as the gloves were on the Clark torso. So basically you managed interfaces and each contractor... Well that would be the job of the contractors to work together which they did not do very well but NASA was in the middle and we made it work. I mean the designs were pretty simple you know hardware is flange mounted one of the reasons flange mounted so you just had to correct the interface, you know, it wasn't a very difficult chore to do at the time. So the interface was actually quite simple. Correct. It's the flange. Flange mounted to the gloves and the helmet. And in the case of the gloves, they actually have both sides of the joint. Correct. But one side of the joint went to the flange, which is just a ring hole. Correct. And the fabric and restraint underneath, you know, the flange mounted to the hardware. You did the same thing for the helmet? Same thing for the helmet. Okay. Yeah. And part of where the concept came from was to make it an easy interface between a good helmet and that. Why did they go to roving for Apollo? Excuse me? You switched to roving for Apollo, though, correct? We didn't choose roving for Apollo. The contractor chose roving. That was latex. And we eventually changed that to flange mounting when we had problems with the roving. To flange mounting. Flange mounting was the best way to do that. And I think I pretty much covered all these things. One additional thing of the 14 suits, five of them were to have an antenna electrical fitting that provided the instrumentation package that was put inside a dummy inside the suit during the ejection process so that when we get to the final point of sled testing with the G1C suit, which used five suits, that they were compatible and provided instrumentation for the for the test. Yes? You've identified many of the features in each iteration of suit designs. In your estimation, were they done by astronaut preferences about comfort and fit, or were those driven by the results of particular tests? I think it was a combination of NASA, new inexperienced engineers having things they wanted to try, contractors who had ideas and concepts they wanted to try and wanted to listen to NASA and try things out that NASA wanted and astronaut evaluations of the products of those two and their inputs that went back into the system and it was an iterative process. It was good in that some of the new engineers that worked for me learned about suits and what to do and importantly what not to do There were lessons learned that you get into a real flight program, you know, you don't want to make mistakes. It's important in a technology program to try things that are creative, innovative, those are buzzwords today, but they're real, to try and achieve the best product. Failures are a success in the long term. That's what the point of the experimental program is, is to try new ideas and evaluate across the spectrum and see what works. Correct. And those new ideas came from not only inexperienced NASA people, but inexperienced contractor people, inexperienced astronauts, so to speak. We haven't done it yet, so what can we do? And the combination ended up with what I think ended up being a good product. I was just trying to imagine how in today's world you could get, what is it, nine or ten prototypes built and tested in two years? Different features all melding"

And the combination ended up with what I think ended up being a good product. I was just trying to imagine how in today's world you could get, what is it, nine or ten prototypes built and tested in two years? Different features all melding together and say, now we're going to put together the right answer. We've had to just design, clean sheet, and press it to build. Well, that's what happened in the Apollo suit program on the early part, which I'm going to do for the next briefing is a very good observation, Good problem. On the Clark suit, you know, the other suits did have like a pouch with a life preserver and stuff like that. Was there any consideration for incorporating survivability features into these suits? Not yet. Other than a pocket on the leg for a life vest, which is not a very workable solution as it turned out, and a neck dam. When you take the helmet off, there was a neck dam. You roll down a neck dam that would seal off a rubber neck seal. Of course one of them was tried to make it out of a plastic S-stain which was a Goodrich product. Can I answer your question? Yes, I guess all the survival equipment was in the seat pan of the ejection system? Correct. The parachute was on a harness that was part of the seat. But it wasn't incorporated into the actual suit assembly? Not yet. Did you have a custom seat pan or did you have a standard design? The seat pan in Gemini? Yeah. It was, I can't remember, McDonald's had a contractor, I can't remember the name of the subcontractor that did the work on the seat, but it was a modified off-the-shelf fighter pilot system, the ejection seat system. So it wasn't a custom molded couch like the Soyuz right now they go through? No, it was not a custom motor couch. Now, we had pads, comfort pads, in the seat for comfort, but not for crash, so to speak. Remember, the crew member would separate from the seat in the event of an ejection and come down on a parachute. So comfort was, I mean, crash protection with the seat-suit combination was not like what you might have today. And you didn't have too rough a landing in your nominal water landing case? It wasn't a huge impact on the stroke? These suits, the Gemini capsule was a nominal parachute water landing. They did look in the early part of Gemini at a paraglider, and that concept was discarded for whatever reasons the project office had at the time. There was no stroke attenuation in the Gemini system? I think what Dick's trying to say is like a rough landing in the water, there was no acceleration protection per se in that ejection scene? No. The real event right now is Apollo had to show its seatbelt. Well, the helmet had a crushable foam liner for head protection during ejection as well as I would assume during water landing, but water landing was by a soft parachute and a very low velocity impact into the water. The issue there was to keep the man afloat and keep water out of the suit to do that. Okay, the next suit, 16 suits made, called the G2C, the second version of Gemini from David Clark. Modeled here by, guess what, Neil Armstrong. He makes an appearance here. In this suit, Clark wanted the helmet program and came up with on their own funds a new helmet. Shown here, a mechanically visor sealed helmet. A larger opening for visual field that the crew members liked. And they came up with new gloves. and NASA of course wanted to have the best product for the crew so we let Clark, we not let Clark, we abandoned from the program the use of the Goodrich helmet and gloves at this point in time for this suit. We had a permanently installed ventilation duct between the helmet and torso through the neck ring. Visual field was equivalent to, or actually was a little better than the G1C suit helmet, which was the Goodrich helmet. Torso neck ring, interoperable system with positive lock. Bearing at the neck ring, of course it was flange mounted. drinking and eating tube provision in the helmet was provided shown here. Exertive probe through the helmet shell, latex type thin air cups for communications that Clark had selected and GFE microphones and earphones that the Gemini program wanted to use to be compatible with the spacecraft communication system. The torso had improved shoulder, hip, waist, and knee mobility. They had redesigned the link net which was the mobility restraint in the Clark suit. Improved single front helmet tie down shown here. The tie down is important so when you're sitting in the suit you want to pull that down so you can lean forward to reach the controls and see the controls and then when you want to be comfortable you release it and you sit back. So you don't have to fight the suit to sit upright. Correct. You cinch it down. You cinch it down and the suit would form that position. Remember this mobility is for a seated crew member position, not a walking suit like an Apollo or Shuttle. The torso, see where we had the blue inter-outlet connectors here, match the color on the gloves. It was picked to have a blue neck ring because at that point there was an integrated vent and that was considered to be the cool side of the ventilation system going into the suit to match the blue inlet connector which was the cooler gas and a red was the outlet. I mean that's sort of the logic behind that and it makes sense or not it's what we did. modified legs to pull in the knees at 3.75, so when you were pressurized at the operating pressure, the knees would form a natural seated knee position, you know, flexed knee position, 45-degree angle, blood pressure cuff fitting on the upper chest, and a combined biomed connector. So this was the G2C suit. This ended up being the training suit configuration for Gemini for all the crew members, as well as the qualification suit for qualification for adequacy of the suit configuration to fly. I didn't mention it had a pressure-sealing slide fastener up the back, and this provided access for waist removal and a seated position for a long-duration mission. To continue with the configuration, we added sizing adjustment to the arms and legs, two inches to adjust the arms and leg length to fit the crew member better. Now, these were custom-fitted suits still, and we sent the crew member up to Clark to be fitted in the suit before delivery. That was part of the acceptance test requirement that the suits fit the crew member, and the crew member signed off that, yep,"

That was part of the acceptance test requirement that the suits fit the crew member, and the crew member signed off that, yep, they fit me. And then it was delivered DD-250 to us. We had a luminized HT fabric cover layer, HT1, that is the DuPont experimental name for Nomex that you probably use today. Back then it was called HT1. Ejection seat compatibility with the boots, 2 to 10 psi pressure indicator on the lower left arm, handkerchief pockets for the cover arms, crew members input there that you mentioned earlier the crew members have an input they wanted pockets, they wanted pockets on the legs for pads, riding pads and operational procedures. NASA emblem finally ended up on a suit and a name tag, the crew members with so-and-so's custom-made fly suit. At just the same time we conducted investigations to look at Teflon coated bladder cloth and Teflon link net restraint cord to see if we could improve the mobility of the suit by having a lower friction knit net where the interbinding cords would slide easier on each other and the net against the bladder would have a smoother surface for lower friction surface and that didn't work too well then you couldn't tell that much difference but it was an attempt eliminated the helmet tie down that was found not to be possible and somebody thought it was a good idea to integrate the parachute harness into the outer suit layer we found that was not a benefit so it was worn outside the cover all of the suit and this was the Gemini suit configuration as I mentioned these are some original copies of original charts that I used to brief crew systems vision management and the project office back when we designated the next version suit to be the g3c or the first flight suit to fly on the Gemini gt3 mission now these were the performance design requirements far as proof pressure operating pressure time duration relief valves we had redundant relief valves, suit pressure indicator, allowable suit leakage with the drinking probe because of adding the drinking probe interface we noticed that the suit leak rate went up so we allowed that. The component leakage rates for each of the components at the time because we individually accepted tested the gloves, helmet, torso and we ran leaks tests on each of those not only pre-flight but for pre-flight at the Cape. Yes, sir? What was the component used to maintain the back pressure in the compressed cabin case? Was it on the suit itself, or was it on the ECS? Did we do what now? If the cabin depressed, what maintained the back pressure inside the suit? Was it on the suit itself, or was it something else? It was part of the environmental control system. Okay, so it was actually on the vehicle. It was part of the vehicle, and the crew member is connected all the time to the inlet and outlet hoses from the ECS system and the spacecraft. You were close to the ECS amount. Yeah. I'm interested in the use of cubic centimeters in a program that is otherwise in pounds. This was a standard that we used for leakage and not pounds mass because we found that it was difficult to measure pounds mass at this low amount of leakage. So we used cc's per minute. Yeah. Pounds mass is only good when you've got larger values that you're trying to measure. Unless you run a long-term test, which we didn't want to do. Measure it over time. Why was 3.7 PSI picked for the... 3.75 was picked by a combination of the engineering community and the medical community to get the lowest pressure suit available and still meet the requirement of no pre-breathe in a spacecraft. Pre-breathe was accomplished from the time the crew member donned the suit in the suit room through a portable oxygen ventilator and entered the spacecraft. And prior to launch, he pre-breathed oxygen. They were oxygen the whole time? They were oxygen the whole time. Two hours minimum was required. Actually, it ran like three and a half to four hours before launch. And that was the lowest suit pressure with those conditions that you could have that was bought off by the medics. Later, that was updated to 4 psi, I think, for the Apollo program. So you're running 4 psi above atmospheric, so you're running 18.7 psi. On the ground. Right, on the ground. which is turned out to be a hazardous condition we get the phone line but anyway pressure drop to be compatible with the ECS system 4.75 inches and that was a critical design feature for the ventilation system and here with the conditions at 11.5 ACFM from the ECF system, inlet gas 100% oxygen with not quite a hundred percent but it was a hundred percent with water moisture, inlet temperature, humidity, ambient pressure, outlet one inch of water. So that was the conditions that were with the man. That's the flow rate from the ECF system, max flow rate. I think nominal is about 10.5. It depends on the design of the ventilation system in the suit, whether or not all the flow goes to the helmet or it's split between the helmet and the torso. All flow here went to the helmet, and I'll show you that in a minute. Now for Apollo, we split that and we had a minimum allowed in Apollo, we'll get into next time, was 4 CFM. But anyway, helmet CO2 removal allowables set up by the medical community. Mobility, of course really our buzzwords, we wanted the maximum available at the operating pressure. tolerated for 14 days with stressing for four hours which was a time that from depressurization in the capsule to the crew member had a safe environment in the atmosphere before you know splashing into the ocean donning be able to parse from a partially dying condition that is with the helmet off and the gloves off he could button up the suit within a maximum of three minutes. The life, Don and Doff for 200 cycles without major overhaul and helmet visor 5,000 cycles of operation on the helmet visor. These were the environmental requirements. I don't intend to go through each item in the table, we'll be here a long time but these were the conditions for each of the environments that was picked the critical criteria and the position of the mission that the requirement was imposed and I don't see you think you'll see anything unusual on that except for the the curves which are next here which give you the min max temperature on the suit some of these requirements came from McDonald aircraft companies report as far as their vibration requirements for the capsule vibration and shock suit inlet flow at this point in time was to be determined for reentry, and it ended up being approximately"

That was at the time this chart was put together. So from that chart, it implies that the capsule ran at about 5 psi? The capsule was 5 psi after launch. OK, was that peroxidase? Almost peroxidase, yes. And here are some additional requirements for oxygen exposure, humidity, noise, acceleration, dynamic loads, which you can see here was for ejection. time in the suit for each of these conditions time pressurized conditions that's at the vent pressure that's at the operating pressure and the total time that event could take place with that requirement that's a certification requirement Jim? Yes These hand littered chargers Hey. How are you? Yes. They are hand-lettered. They were done by a guy in the graphic arts. It was Ray Brunow, if anybody knew Ray back then. He did these charts for me on a large board. We didn't have computers back then, as you recall. I mean, I recall. They're so consistent, I'm thinking there's maybe a letter guy. These were hand-lettered by Ray. He was a really terrific, terrific guy. And, you know, I wasn't going to, for this briefing, I wasn't going to go back and try and reproduce all this because I couldn't do a better job, I don't think, on a computer. Was there any O2 provided to the crew during the parachute? I can't hear you, sir. In the ejection scenario, what kind of oxygen was provided to the crew? 100% oxygen from the seat kit. Okay, so you would stay with the seat until an altitude that you would separate? Correct. The seat kit, correct. Okay. As long as he had the parachute, it became part of the parachute. These don't show up too well. These were the curves. And the interesting one here is the temperature inside the vehicle cabin and for how long that crew member would be subjected to, which would be a maximum of 200 degrees for 20 minutes in the cabin. This chart shows in the green here, barely make it out, is the temperature during ejection and the flow rate that you had mentioned that due to the change in the increase in atmospheric pressure as he descended on the parachute. And of course, here's the start of parachute deployment. There was no liquid cooling in these suits at this time? There was no forced air cooling into the suits? Yes. OK. This is the ventilation system that I mentioned to you that was pretty unique. We had a neck ring and glove disconnects that had integral vent channels that there was no connections required to get ventilation into the hands or into the helmet. The inlet flow went from the inlet fitting directly up to the helmet and then out of the helmet down through the arms and out through the outlet that way and this way and all went to the outlet. Here's just a brief overview of the suit configuration at launch with the helmet with the protective liner I mentioned, earphones, drinking port, disconnects, benton linen outlet, bio-med fitting. You see the parachute installed, the boot stirrups, location of pressure ceiling slide fastener up through the waist. I keep calling it slide fastener because zipper is a term that's a trademark of Talon Company and the correct name that I was told to use by our legal people was pressure sealing slide fastener. So that's what I call it. It's a zipper in a sense, double zipper. So the air is basically your cooling system. Are there any... It's the oxygen that's the cooling. Yeah. So is there any manifolding of that ductwork? Can you, like, change the flow rate, or was that built in? All the flow came into the inlet, went to the helmet, okay? Yeah. And then out from the red to the outlet. It just flowed over the body for cooling. You couldn't adjust. You've got four major paths, five major paths out of the inlet. Right. Could that be valved in any way or was that preset at the factory? No, that's all preset. And we ran multiple tests by the physiology lab for CO2 removal, and at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base did a lot of heat stress tests of the ventilation system to arrive at this configuration as being optimal for the conditions that this suit would have to meet. And was that a molded ductwork or was that tubular? Soft tubular, soft tubes covered with neoprene-coated fabric. And then a cushion layer here at the inland that pressed against the body, but it was very thin, so it was not a pressure point. Thanks. Here are the actual suits showing the location entrance closure. We've talked about that, the ECS connectors, the pressure sealing layer on the inside with neoprene coated nylon, a comfort liner which was used on the very most inside of the suit as a donning aid to make the inside of the suit slippery for donning the legs and arms, and the link net structural restraint for the mobility features. This was the Biomed instrumentation that was located in the suit to the 31 pin connector. We had a blood pressure inflation bulb that could inflate the blood pressure cuff on the arm with a microphone located under it. We had signal conditioners and a signal conditioner pack and an oral temperature probe in the helmet and of course the EKG electrodes on the chest all fed to a harness that come out through this 31 pin connector. How reliable was the biomedical system? Data drops? It worked very well. When the crew member donned the suit in the suit room at the Cape, the biomedical people were there, were responsible for attaching the instrumentation to the crew member and checking it out with their console that was their responsibility so when they say it was okay whether it came off or undone in flight that was their responsibility We did. Thank you. Here's a view of the helmet with a real temperature probe located, I mentioned. Of course, the mechanical visor, the Dave Clark visor, the earphone pads, microphones, which were government-furnished, and the drink water gun came from the spacecraft through a hose to the inlet to the helmet. I haven't mentioned the fingertip lights that we used and developed during the Mercury program, but here they're shown on a battery pack with wiring down to the fingertips, palm restraint bar, and of course the lights down on the fingertips. This shows the pre-water entry configuration with an inflatable life vest that came out and was"

This shows the pre-water entry configuration with an inflatable life vest that came out and was worn in packets that inflated under the arm and it was attached to the restraint harness we had self-sealing disconnects on the connectors and a neck dam deployed neck dam this is tom gallagher if you mean anybody familiar with tom gallagher may have been around yeah it looks like somewhere along the way we lost the silver mylar yes That happened on the G3C suit. That the testing of the plume from an exploding Titan II rocket and the, and there were some tests where that actually happened, they got real data, versus the requirements that was levied on a parachute and the restraint harness in the suit was such that we could do away with the aluminized mylar. And at that time, DuPont came up with this high-temperature nylon, HD1, or Nomex as it's called today, which satisfied the temperature requirements. So we became white instead of silverized. I understood that was an and as opposed to a replacement. Thanks. Yeah. Are these still good, rich, unsilverized at this point? As I mentioned, Clark came up with a new helmet that they'd been working on for the Air Force and new gloves that they'd been working on for the Air Force that were found to be superior to the Goodrich helmet and gloves and were incorporated for the first time in a G3C. Did you have to have an injection port at all? injection port for medications at all for the parameters or is that not until Apollo? We ran tests to see what kind of leak rate we'd end up with with a injection cartridge shooting a medical injection to the thigh and a leakage increase was considered minimal. For this application, for Apollo, that didn't work. We had to go to a patch because we have much longer pressurized wear time. This was four hours, and Apollo was 14 days. Okay. Now we're going to move on to the next suit, which were the modifications to the suit that was worn by Gus Grissom and John Young on GT-1. These were an homage to the G3C suit to make it an EVA suit. which is a visor for visual impact and micro media protection. We changed Nomex link net and the restraint layer for increased structural strength. Here was the first application of Nomex into the line of nylon. Redundant pressure sealing closure, that is we in addition to the sealing zipper, we had a added restraint zipper, which made a redundant assembly for reliability purposes. We redesigned the ventilation in-lock fittings with automatic lock and redundant sealing features so uh... it was easier to connect or disconnect the hoses or the fittings to the ancillary life support system that would be used during EVA. We replaced the Nomex cover layer with integrated thermal micrometeorite cover layer and gloves a new design with increased mobility and resistance. Here is the layup of the suit with those features, of course starting with the underwear worn underneath the suit, a comfort liner for donning aid, the pressure bladder, the link net I mentioned, we had a bumper layer, layers of HT1 felt, Luminized thermal layer, mylar, felt layer of HD1, and an outer layer of HD1. That was the layup for the GT4 suit shown here. Pretty much looks like the standard G3C suit, except there's added bulk due to the cover layer design. And, of course, we had an added visor, a pull-down visor that integrated with the pivots on the sides of the helmet. Other than that, the pressure gauge, the relief valves in the legs, the fittings were pretty much located in the same positions as before. Now, to get away from the design part of it, here is how we qualified the suit for flight. and this was for GT 3 and 4 which was both a G3C suit and a G4C suit and the height the different temperature environments that the suit was subjected to in a thermal box located on the either the outside of the 8-foot chamber in building 7 or the outer lock of the 20-foot chamber in building 7 and this This was a vacuum compatibility was in a 20-foot chamber. Rapid decompression was in a parasite chamber, the 20-foot chamber, to demonstrate rapid decompression capability of the suit. Oxygen compatibility was done by materials people in the envirotron chamber in Building 32, I think at the time it was located. Comfort in the Apollo cabin and ECS simulator that had been developed and installed in Building and pressure drop in the eight-foot chamber in in building seven. So those were some of the tests and when they were conducted in the in the in a suit. Yes. Here's additional test of the it was done in materials lab materials world by Fred Don and his team, the total suit composite, the visor testing, the helmet, O-rings, zippers, wrist connection, seals, elbow section, neck and helmet connection, band hose fitting. All the materials used in these different layups was subjected to materials testing to be compatible with oxygen and and the environments that were required on those tables that I showed earlier. I have a question. Sure. So how did qualification work? Did you guys take delivery of the suits from the prime, and basically you guys took care of all the testing? We took care of the testing and ran it from JSC. Now, the contractor did lifecycle testing, which is the best place to do that type of test. but in the field we did all the environment testing in chambers and in mock-ups at both here and at McDonnell Douglas. In the environmental control system simulator they had out at Air Research where they who was responsible as a subcontractor for the Gemini life support system. And for the materials testing we actually had Clark David Clark build materials layup sections and provided them to our materials people for the testing so they didn't need a whole suit they just materials layups most of them were 14 by 14 inch square layups that were sewn together using the standard layup construction of the suit And in addition, these tests were run in those composites, including the sun visor, boots, boot sole, thermal mittens. And those were the type of testing that was done. Quite a bit of materials testing was done. And this was the first time that this amount of testing was done on a suit. We didn't do this in mercury. much. We did do some in Mercury of course for compatibility with the vehicle but not as to the extent we did here. Now the G5C. Back in early June"

We didn't do this in mercury. much. We did do some in Mercury of course for compatibility with the vehicle but not as to the extent we did here. Now the G5C. Back in early June 1965 McDonnell Douglas was concerned about the heat buildup in the spacecraft when it was fully stowed with all the expendables, food, water, clothing, what have you, experiments in a capsule for a 14-day mission. So they took and put two crew members wearing standard Air Force flying suits with masks and helmets in a test chamber, vacuum chamber they had at McDonnell Douglas, and they ran a test with the Environmental Control System and found that the unsuited crew person had better favorable results with the ECS system than a suited crew person as far as heat buildup in a spacecraft. So they suggested or recommended to NASA that they consider taking the suits off during the mission, which would have been a very difficult job and would have been hazardous because in the event of a decompression, the time to put the suit parts back on would have been unacceptable. So Jim Correale, who was in the crew systems division at that point, recommended that we develop a suit taking advantage of the features that we developed during the early advanced development program. Here they come back in the program again with the G5C suit. and the requirement that was levied on Clark for this suit was 14 day duration mission which was real for for Gemini 7 rapid decompression protection with the rapid reentry being accepted which mean you could take a little more time to put the gloves on and the helmet but still be compatible with the ejection seat and this was the features of this suit g5c as a crew member is walking up to the pad was to be removable in flight was a requirement although during the mission they did not take the whole suit off but they they could have if they felt like they needed to. It was lightweight 16 pounds which was about the third of the weight of the Gemini standard G3C or 4C suit. Soft cloth hood with the pressure sealing closure shown here and allowable increase in leakage to a thousand cc's to make the suit completely as lightweight and still maintain some flexibility and this was made possible by the fact that we would have a rapid re-entry and did not require the the long-term four-hour leakage requirement to be compatible with the ECS system. These were still semi custom fitted like the helmets were like were standard but the suit was standard fitted for the crew members. Yes, you can see here in this picture, that's a good question, set me up. There was an impact helmet worn on the inside of that helmet for crash protection. Not crash necessarily, but for impact protection. And the boots and the gloves could be completely removed. had a pressurizable vent sock and vent system attached to the torso but these were the restraints and here is the guy all buttoned up fred spross was the subject here and still had the same inlet outlet connector same 32 pin connector basically the same disconnects no neck ring and a very very comfortable suit that was a g5c Here you can see Frank Borman and I think Jim Lovell over there wearing the suit in a fully donned position in a seat position and Frank Borman here wearing the suit in a nominal condition in the vehicle. That's the electrode on his head. That is an electrode on his head. That was one of the added biomed features. The suit seems to have exaggerated shoulder pads on it. Is that to get... I think that's just the way they were made for comfort, to have excess bulk in the shoulders. For comfort. Is there a neck dam for water? There is no neck dam. At this point in time, the mission, when this flew on Gemini 7, the system for reentry and location of a crew member when the capsule landed on the water was pretty reliable, and so they, I assume they waived that requirement. Here were the Gemini flights that the different suits supported, starting with the first flight with Gus with suit serial number 3C1 and Young with C4. 1965, their total time in flight was almost five hours. The first EVA flight by Ed White where we did the EVA spacewalk and even though we had G4C suit he had available to him an added shoulder cover for thermal protection. That was in 65. His flight lasted almost 98 hours. The EVA was 23 minutes long and the life support system was a vent control module as it was called that provided pressurization and life support. and during the mission there were no suit difficulty at all reported. Of course GT-5 Cooper Conrad and G4C suits 190 almost 191 our mission. Six with Schirra and Stafford. Schirra wanted a G3C suit because it was less bulky and he had more room in the seat and so he flew a 3C suit as all the other people run 4Cs. Of course none of these, this flight had no EVA, this had no EVA. Here's another flight, this was the long duration flight with Borman and Lovell that wore the G5C suit and how many hours they wore it in flight. Here's the first EVA scheduled flight that EVA was aborted due to a spacecraft problem And on this flight, the life support system was the environmental control life support system and umbilical. Why did they go back to the 4C suit? Why did they do what? Go back to the 4C suit. 4C was an EVA suit. And the 5C was not. 5C was not. 5C was strictly intervehicular. The construction was just, it had no comfort liner, it strictly had a bladder, pressure sealing bladder and an outer nylon restraint cover with no joint features built in. It was strictly a bulky long term wear suit to provide protection in the event of rapid decompression of the spacecraft. That was the light suit. It was just a lightweight suit for that long mission. And this mission was conducted to satisfy a medical requirement that, you know, could a man survive in flight for 14 days, which was an Apollo requirement. This demonstrated that these were all test flights for Apollo. Some of them demonstrate rendezvous capability and increasingly complex missions. Like on GT-9 with Tom and Gene, we had a test of an astronaut maneuvering unit, which ended up being terminated to higher workloads on a crew member, which caused excessive visor fogging, which prevented him from seeing, and he terminated the activity of the AMU. He wore a special multi-layer chromel R H1 film TMG on the legs since the AMU operated with peroxide, I guess, nitrogen"

He wore a special multi-layer chromel R H1 film TMG on the legs since the AMU operated with peroxide, I guess, nitrogen peroxide. I think I got that right. and could end up subjected to the suit legs to a temperature of like 1800 degrees F. Jim, was the ProModel R, was that a GFE? Did NASA do that, or was that? I was talking to Buzz the other day, a couple weeks ago, and he said he wore that same TMG on 12th. Buzz told me he wore it for his flight. The MWU was supposed to be on that flight as well. I don't think he wore that suit in flight. He was telling me he wore the chromelar on his flight. He did on Apollo. No, on 12th. He was supposed to do the MWU. I'll defer to him, but my records show and photographs show that he did not. I think he's mistaken, to be honest with you. Could be. Now we had Chromelar gloves and boots on Apollo. And it was a very expensive material. Chromelar is a stainless steel woven fabric. And the process of making it involves using machine oil. And to be compatible with oxygen, it had to be very precision, clean to be oxygen compatible. And in Apollo, it ended up being like $5,000 a square yard. And we bought it in 50 yard lots for the Apollo program. And here they just bought them in a smaller lot. During the course of the Gemini program, was there any glove development for enhanced EVA capability for glove dexterity while you were doing the EVAs? There were some, yes. Each crew member in a suit fit checks had different sizing features incorporated to make them more comfortable and more tactile for him. There's not much of a record that I could find about what these, I won't call them modifications, but changes were for each crew member. I know for Ed White's flight, I was sent up to Clark to expedite delivery of his flight EVA gloves. I spent a period of about six weeks up there as a resident NASA person to buy off the design and get the suit and gloves delivered on time to the Cape, which they made it just within a few days' time. Those are the days we worked that way. My last chart, well here's a picture of that shoulder cover that Ed White had available to him to use. I don't have any record of him actually using it to be honest. And here is Cernan on GT9 with his Chromilar TMG showing the leg sections that was used for this very bulky astronaut maneuvering unit, and then on his life support system on the front, which was the ECLSS. Now, lessons learned from the program in my last chart. For gas cooling, we found it was inadequate for labor-intensive EVA tasks that resulted in crew member overheating and helmet visor fogging. We actually aborted an EVA because of that. Mobility of pressurized joints and gloves impacts coulomb over capability to perform tasks, which caused high metabolic loads and difficulty in donning foot restraints. Helmet anti-fog solution was lost over time, and we learned we had to apply it just before an EVA, and I think they still do that in shuttle, or did do that in shuttle. Neutral buoyancy procedure training contributes significantly to crew members' proficiency. And there was a question earlier about this, contractor participation and development and qualification is highly desirable and beneficial, especially life cycle endurance cycle testing. And as we talked about earlier, technology development provides new engineers, both contractor NASA, excellent, hands-on in a lot of cases, wearing the suit, training for design, test, and contract technical management. Highly desirable. Yes, sir? When you did the neutral buoyancy evaluation, I've seen pictures of Buzz and other folks wearing weight belts and things. Do you remember what you had to do for a lighter weight suit to go through and get it to be neutrally buoyant at all? Were you able to do those prove-outs for the EVAs? No. Write that question down and I'll get you an answer and I'll get it to Cinda if you want. I'll do that with anybody. In fact, if you have a further on question, just get them to Cinda and she'll get them to me and then I'll provide a quick response, hopefully. I need to mention the qualification testing for a moment. Do you qualify the suit as a whole or do you try to qualify it like individual components like gloves and boots and helmet? How is that in English? We learned that doing the suit as a whole for cycle testing where man loads are a factor was the only way to do the testing. For environmental testing, for high temperature compatibility, we used gloves like with the parasite on the 20 foot chamber I think we had back then. Helmet impact testing we did with the helmet alone with the impact rig to test the visor impact protection. Communications were tested independently. So yes, it was a mixture of the two. But mostly it was completely suited for mobility, flexibility, pressure drop. The weakies was done unmanned of the whole suit, but for acceptance testing we did individual parts. It was a mixture of the two. Jim, the underwater testing found that Jim was 12. Was that a spot you used? We used his training suit. What is his training suit? Training suit.. Yes. During this program we had one training suit, one flight suit per crewman, and one flight backup suit for the prime crew. We changed that during Apollo. And we had a backup crew, you know, that also had their suit, their prime flight suit. So, underwater testing, if you've got one training suit, and you've done all your pit checks and pressure checks, what else are you going to do with it? And you throw it in the water? Well, the water test was a unique... I don't think they did it very often. So it was cleaned up afterwards and redone for other events. Like the procedure strainer. It wasn't a repeated type activity. Yes, sir? In the introduction, it was mentioned that you're working on a book to capture the lessons learned in science. Have you seen the book that you just did one show, an opera class here called Space, and the extensive description of evolution of the design? I think I'm really focusing on the model. I have seen it. I have seen several books put out by different people including Joe McMahon and his counterpart from Hampton Standard. I find they have a lot of inaccuracies but"

I mean There are a lot of inaccuracies, and I've tried to be as thorough with accuracy as I am with the facts for the Gemini activity. And I may have missed some, to be honest. I mean, there was, I, in certain parts of that advanced development, I got a little confused myself on the different suits and what configuration each suit was. because it was not well documented by the engineers. When they made a mod and they tested it and they changed the suit and remodified it, it was a very low, fast-paced, like you say, record. And I tried to do the best I could at the time. Thank you."

He's been a name in suits for a long time. He started out going to school at the University of Dayton in Ohio and went on to the University of Houston later on. But it was that time that he spent as an undergraduate. He was a test subject at the Langley Air Force Base, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, and then went on to work at Langley afterwards. But it was that critical time as a student. He was a test subject, and by being a test subject, he was able to participate in some of those critical testing for human performance in environments. And then more specifically, they did suit testing in that time frame as well. as well. And that experience led him on to be hired by NASA to work at Langley. And then he followed on and came on to JSC. He continued his career in spacesuits and he is a legacy, he leaves a legacy in spacesuit development. His work ranges the programs all the way from Mercury, Gemini, Skylab, Polo Soyuz, Polo Shuttle, and so on. And he was a great person Space Station, you name it, Jim's worked every one of those programs. And we're very, very fortunate to have him here today. He went on, he became a branch chief, and after he retired from NASA, he went to work for ILC Dilver. And then after there for a time period, he left and started his own company as a consultant. And so he has agreed to offer up several of these knowledge capture events for us, solely dedicated to United States spacesuits. And today he's going to be talking on Apollo Block 1 and the Block 2 competition. So with no other words to be said, what a great opportunity for you to be here, for us to have you here today. Let's give him a warm welcome. Thank you, Cinda. It was, they say, legacy. It was just a job at the time, you know, a good job, and I enjoyed it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have stayed around for some 39 years with NASA. But I enjoyed it, and I hope I can share some of the experiences and knowledge that I have acquired to you. And today I'm going to talk about the Block 1 spacesuit development and the development of the competition and the history of the competition, which utilized developments that were conducted back then and ended up at the time was supposed to have been a space suit used for lunar missions in the Apollo program. But as it turned out, it was the suit that was used for all of the Apollo missions. This is the agenda on Apollo Block 1. I'm going to get a little bit into chronology of events, the requirements for the Block 1 suit, the configuration of the suit, and a little bit about procurement of the suit 1 and how it was terminated at the end of the Apollo Block 1 program. Then I'll go on to the Block II spacesuit competition, a little bit of chronology, what suits were in the competition, some details about the novel test plan that was established and implemented and details about that and then the results of that competition and how the results of that competition were incorporated into the NASA Apollo program. And then of course I always try and give you a little bit of an idea of some lessons learned from my perspective, once again looking over the history of all of this. Now to talk about the chronology, definition of block, you know block one and block two came about back in January 1964 when North American Aviation presented the block change concept to then manned spacecraft center. North American Aviation were having problems in the design of the command module and service module and as a result of the necessity to incorporate significant design changes proposed to NASA that Block 2 would become the lunar mission spacecraft, and on an interim basis there would be the Block 1 spacecraft that was used only for Earth orbital missions. And some of these changes to the command module were to reduce the weight. It was overweight for the lunar activity. The center of gravity was not in spec. And there were other critical interfaces that were required to be developed between Grumman and North American to establish the configuration of the command service module for lunar missions. Back during this time, the crew systems division was looking at an interim configuration suit to fly on early Apollo missions. and this was of course the Gemini suit because at this time the Gemini program was being developed and was getting ready to be flown on a Gemini program. So the Crew System Division was looking at a backup to the then ongoing Apollo spacesuit program to use for early flights. In April of 64 there was a critical test out at North American where for the first time they put three crew members side by side in the command module couches and found that there was an interface problem between the crew members arms in order to operate the necessary controls and switches and what have you in the command module. Previous tests that were conducted conducted previously using the Apollo spacesuit then was a one-man activity and no problems were identified. At that point in time, in May 1964, a decision was made to use Gemini suits for the Block 1 missions. Reason for that was a substantial financial saving for the early part of the program, which was experiencing financial cost problems. And primarily, the existing HAM Standard ILC Apollo suit program was not producing adequate results in terms of a configuration that would be needed for lunar missions. So use of the Apollo Block I suit would allow more time for the HAM Standard contract team to establish a design of a satisfactory suit for the Block 2 lunar missions. In addition, a highlight of this activity was to design the Apollo suit shoulders and elbows to eliminate that problem of interference with three crew members and the couches in the command module. In June, the Manned Spacecraft Center directed North American through the Apollo Program Office to take whatever steps were necessary to design in the Block 1 spacesuit to be compatible with the command module. In addition, in July, NASA gave the David Clark Company, manufacturer of the Gemini spacesuit activity, to use the suit for the Apollo Block 1 program, and a formal contract award was scheduled for later that year. In October, the Crew Systems Division initiated studies to look at just what are the interface issues with the use of the Apollo 1 suit with the command module, in particular the environmental control system. And there were problems identified regarding cabin temperature and carbon dioxide partial pressure with three crewmen wearing the suits full time buttoned up inside the command module. This mode of operation over a long period of time had an adverse effect on cabin dewpoint temperature and water condensation rate. In November, manned spacecraft sims determined that lights on the spacesuit gloves were a beneficial part of the command module interface in terms of providing lighting inside the command module. And at that time, the astronauts preferred the use of red bulbs rather than the white that was used on the Gemini program for Block 1 application. In September through December, CSD approved the use of the modified Gemini spacesuit in Apollo Block 1 spacecraft. And the Gemini contract was amended to provide for the design and fabrication of a prototype Block 1 suit. Back in November of 64, Max Fischay, who was the Director of Engineering, decreed by direction to all elements of the main spacecraft"

Back in November of 64, Max Fischay, who was the Director of Engineering, decreed by direction to all elements of the main spacecraft center then that the name for the Apollo spacesuit would be changed to Extravehicular Mobility Unit, which would be used then for the combination of the PLIS and what was then called Pressure Garment Assembly for the Apollo program. program, in fact for all programs back at that time. In January the preliminary design review was held at North American with significant problems being identified. Differences between the wear cycle and requirement of donning the suits in the command module was identified a problem to be resolved. Manned Spacecraft Center Crew Assistance Division's plan was that crew member would wear the suits all the time but without helmets and possibly even gloves during the first several missions. Eventually the program manager, based on the division recommendations in his systems engineering division, concluded that the command module should be outfitted for partial suit wear during normal mission operations and that in the event of decompression of the spacecraft there would be adequate time for that operation except for catastrophic failure, and the failure we're talking about were seals inside the command module to the hatch and other protrusions, that it would be okay to use a partial wear suit because the dining time of the helmet or gloves would be adequate to meet the needs before full decompression would occur and the spacecraft would still be operable by suited crew members. There were tests run to determine the time that would be required to don and doff a block-bound suit assembly inside the command module, with two subjects averaging donning times for 9 minutes, 33 seconds, and 10 minutes, and the mean doffing times were 4 minutes, 5 seconds, and 5 minutes, 23 seconds. So based on this, it was determined that partial wear by just removing the gloves and helmet would be adequate and it wouldn't be necessary to have a full suit donning inside the command module by all three crew members. In February also, NASA got agreement with the Navy Air Crew Lab in Philadelphia to begin testing of Gemini Block 1 spacesuit configuration in a wide range of environmental temperatures to determine comfort and physiological responses, which were all found satisfactory for use in the Block 1 program. In February, NASA reached an agreement with David Clark on a sole-source contract for the Apollo Block 1 spacesuits with the first delivered suits, which were then called Program Support Suits, to go to North American Aviation for interface testing with the command module. Just as a time reference, in March of 1965 was the first successful Project Gemini flight, GT-3, with Gus Grissom and John Young. In March of 1965, crew systems recommended a full shirt sleeve environment be kept in the command module. The design was simpler and more reliable, and provided greater personal comfort than wearing a spacesuit during the entire mission. In November of 1965, CSD reviewed and approved the majority of Block I spacesuit drawings. Open issue at the time was the helmet ear cups for communications compatibility with the earphones and microphones. And North American Dave Cox specifications were changed to reflect the revised ear cup mechanism inside the Block 1 David Clark helmet. So was the shirt sleeve decision based on that nine-minute dialing time? Yes. It was a long period of time for a catastrophic decompression, but for what the North American reliability people determined was acceptable for seals and slow leak decompressions, that a partial wear would be adequate. That was the basis for that decision. This is the program plan that was implemented. It was a year-and-a-half program at the time to develop prototype suit, support suits, and the flight and qual suit. It ended back then in the mid-'66. This is the procurement plan that was instituted for the Block 1 spacesuit procurement. The existing Gemini contract, NAS 9-1396, Amendment 6, Mod 12, if you're interested in details, was implemented. and the objective was to establish a review of the command module specifications and incorporate modifications as necessary for compatibility. It was determined that the Gemini 3C intervehicular spacesuit at the time would be the baseline from which changes would be made. And, of course, at that time, the G4C extravehicular suit was being developed for the GT-4 mission. but since block one was strictly intervehicular only, no extravehicular activity, the G3C was selected as the baseline configuration for upgrades for block one. And of course, to minimize costs and work and activity was the direction that David Clark was to employ all existing Gemini specs and processes wherever practical and possible to implement Block 1. And to fabricate and deliver a prototype, QUAL, program support and training flight suits, I think a total of 66 Block 1 suits were under contract at the time. Not all were delivered because in January of 67, there was a catastrophic accident that occurred on the pad where we lost three crew members. and that sort of ended the Block 1 program at the time. And, of course, we lost all three crew members in the Apollo 1 fire. At the time it was called SA-204, for your information. It's Apollo Saturn Mission 204. So that was the end of the Block 1 suit program. The contract was terminated, and no further effort was implemented or supported other than investigation that was conducted to determine the cause of the Block 1, Apollo 1 fire. And at that point, all effort on the Block 1 effort was terminated. Now I'm going to switch over to some of the design and performance requirements of the Apollo Block 1. And if you were here for my presentation on the Gemini spacesuit program, these requirements are very similar, if not identical in most cases, to what was the Gemini suit requirements for pressure, leakage, ventilation system, pressure drop, and helmet CO2 removal and activity. I don't intend to get into all the details of this, except to say that these were all certified too, but mostly by similarity to the Gemini suit qual test program. These were the performance design requirements that were implemented from Apollo Block 1 and these slides were from a set of slides that I used back then to brief division management and the program office on the suit program. I mean these are copies of really old slides. was to be adequate for all activities at the maximum suit pressure 3.7, which was the suit pressure at that time.

And pressurized for a period up to four hours, which was a period of time that was max time for getting ready for reentry of donning the suits and full donning of the suits or partial donning of the suits if that was the situation in up to four hours. And in a partial donning situation, donning time requirement was three minutes total per person, which was the certification requirement. The life assembly, consecutive cycles, pretty standard and mostly were satisfied by the Gemini requirements. To continue, the helmet and bearing disconnects, you know, the cycle life, ventilation inlet and outlet connectors, the in-flight helmet drinking probe port be operated without failure for that number of cycles and the number of pressure sealing closure cycles before failure. That was one that I don't think was ever met in the QUAL program or the operational flight program. Not due to catastrophic problems of loss of pressure but mostly excessive leakage which the spec was I think 150 cc's at the time and that was never really truly met. This was the fingertip light requirements, including the use of the red tinted lenses which was requested by the astronauts for use in Apollo Block 1 and its characteristics. Now then this side shows the modifications to the Gemini suit required for command module interface. Ventilation gas connectors and nozzles were redesigned to provide for a self-locking feature when a crew member was connecting the nozzle to the suit, that once you put it in, that the lock would automatically engage with the connector and it would lock in place. Of course the shrug cutter used in Gemini was deleted, that was of course used for the ejection seat parachute combination operation and was not required. The restraint layer in the suit, the link net restraint layer was changed and that's a typo on there, H plus, it should be HT1, which now is called Nomex in the current vernacular. And that was changed to provide for less restraint ballooning, which had an effect on mobility and ability to meet the command module interface requirements from three crew members side by side in the seeks. Of course, fingertip lighting system to have the red lenses. The interface between the boot and the command module couch required the use of a Velcro disc to restrain the feet inside the couch on landing. The undergarment was changed to be compatible with the Apollo bio-instrumentation, which was different than in Gemini. There was a visor protector shield, so to speak, put on the helmet to protect the helmet visor when it was in the up position from bumping into the command module side structure. The relief valves were deleted except for when you were using the suits in the chamber test. and the wrist bearing disconnects and the neck disconnects were all modified to use a G4C type, which provided an improved ventilation type system. Did those finger tip lights require batteries in the suit? They were batteries on the glove. On the glove. Was there any other power in the suit or did it get everything from the umbilicals? Everything came through the umbilical to the biomed, including comm. It all went through one single connector, and I'll show you that in a minute. I'll show you the suit. These are the changes that resulted from the Gemini 4C suit, extra-hequator suit program. Mobility was improved through the use of the HT1 link net design and some other designs in the link net structure itself. And I mentioned the inlet and outlet fittings to incorporate the automatic locking feature. And the gloves were redesigned for increased mobility. That was an ongoing continuing program from Gemini to Apollo Block 1 where Block 1 took advantage of all the latest improvements in the Gemini X vehicular glove, less the TMG. The EV glove was not used in Block 1, it was just a basic pressure restraint with a cover layer type covering on the glove. and incorporate ventilation provisions and improve abrasion and tear function with the use of the outer covering on the glove. And the Gemini 4 wrist-bearing disconnects and neck-bearing disconnect, which provided a ventilation pass-through. And, of course, as I mentioned, the restraint layer HD1. This shows the suit where the protection liner inside the helmet, the earphones, redundantly wired earphones, The pressurized drinking port will provide water to the crew member in the pressurized suit if required. The helmet torso tie-down system to prevent elongation of the suit when the crew member was restrained in the couch. Storage pocket for the neck dam, which was a different approach than what was used in Gemini and Mercury. In this case, the neck dam was stored in a pocket, which could be self-installed on a suit if the helmet was removed. The glove disconnect bearing, outlet and inlet, the fingertip lighting with the battery pack right there on the glove, the Gemini pressure sealing closure entry method, pressure indicator on the arm, accessory pockets. The telemetry fitting was for biomed and communications and the neck bearing and on the bottom of the Velcro disc to provide restraint to the crew member's feet in the command module couch. Yes? What was the advantage of the red lighting on the fingertips over white? Crew member, astronaut preference. They felt that they had better lighting inside the command module. Some of the command module lighting was deleted in a review at Rockwell, a North American, later become Rockwell. And they felt that red lighting offered increased visibility for inside the command module. Like if you're in a darkened room at night, red-covered flashlight, your button see without having your eyes use their dark vision. That was sort of a crew request implemented item based on their evaluation inside the lighting simulator that was in existence for command module lighting test and evaluation. Was that used at all on aircraft at the time, or was that something new? I think this was the first time that fingertip lights were actually used on spacesuit gloves with a red lens and it worked out fine and it was flown as eventually for all the applications later on. Now the shuttle and a lot of modern aircraft have a backlit panel. Right. Did the Apollo... Did not have that. Yeah. Remember you got to think about the technology that existed at the time. This is a ventilation system which was sort of unique for the Gemini G4C and Block 1 is that the pass-through vent ducts from the to the helmet actually went through the neck ring. When you connected the helmet to the neck ring it automatically engaged the ventilation inlet that went to the helmet for co2 removal inside the helmet.

Likewise there was on a wrist disconnects was a pass through that allowed the inlet gas to go right through the disconnect into the glove duct which aided in the donning time and access ease to don the gloves for use in block one. And of course the flow came through the inlet over the whole suit and this was a vent pass inside the suit down to the feet to provide foot covering and then back to the over the body and to the outlet connector to the back to the ECS system. The system worked very effectively and was found to be quite a good system in those tests that was conducted by the Navy and also within the crew systems division. This is some views of the actual suit. I point out on the helmet there's this helmet protector. It was a Cyc-a-lac plastic, very lightweight and very bump and scratch, provided scratch protection to the lens when the helmet up was in the open position. Life vest attachment points that were provided on the suit because they were stored on a pocket which I'll show you in a little while. Of course the vent inlet and outlet, gloves, entry, torso, boots. This is the link net structure inside the suit and then a pressure retention layer. And inside the suit was a blue nylon comfort liner that helped in the ease of donning the suit. outer layer of HT1 pretty much the Gemini suit with the modifications that were needed did the boots have a bearing ring on them the way the gloves did or did they have a latch on them the only bearings were in a neck ring and a wrist disconnect the boots were permanently attached to the suit I'll back up here for you. There were no, they actually were laced to the restraint, and the bladder extended down inside the boot, so they were never removed. This was the constant wear garment that was worn under the basic suit, and provisions were provided for irradiation of cylinder pockets. Back at this point in time, there was a new discovery, the Vallis-Allen radiation belts. There was a big concern about the amount of radiation a crew member would be exposed to. In fact, at one point, they were looking at using a plexiglass visor that was almost a half an inch thick compared to the thinner visor to provide radiation protection for the eyes. That was found not to be required, but it was something that we looked at back then. And of course, it had a zipper opening for donning and a harness quick disconnect, detachable belt with amplifiers installed, radiation dissemblers on the legs, and integrated socks. These were the installed accessories starting with pencil disseminators, pen light on the pockets on the arm, sunglasses, scissors, the neck dam water egress seal I talked about, flight checklist pockets, urine, male urine collection device that was developed for mercury and used in Gemini and again in Block 1. Life vest assembly that was snapped on in place on top of the outer layer cover layer of the suit, marking pens, pencils, and these were the dosimeters that were installed in the suit. Here is the suit in the water immersions configuration with the life vest, the in-house JSC developed life vests, a neck dam, and the suit at bent pressure demonstrating the capability for bending the legs and kneeling down at operating pressure. This shows a good shot of the neck seal that allowed the visor to open and be located on the back side of the helmet and the little slot here is allowed the locking feature mechanism to go inside. That is pretty much the Block 1 program. Unfortunately we lost three crew members wearing this configuration suit on the Apollo 1 fire and it was not used again. What was the outer fabric on the suit? The outer fabric on the suit was Nomex. Back then it was called HT-1. That was the development trade name from DuPont. And it's now used and called Nomex. Yes, sir. A couple questions. When the suit was to be worn in the command module in the unpressurized, you know, the partial wear configuration, was it still hooked up to the hoses for ventilation? Yes, to the ECS system. So the crew members were ventilated the entire time they were wearing the suit, even if the suit was unpressurized? Well, there wasn't very good ventilation because if you looked at that ventilation diagram I showed you, the ventilation went to the helmet outlets and the gloves. There wasn't too much, but it was adequate. The second question is I read once in a pre-flight press conference, Ed White was asked the question about why they didn't consider the G5C for Apollo for the Block 1, and he said the visibility for the visor was not adequate. but did you have any thoughts about the soft suit as a use in Block 1? The G5C was a long-duration, completely in-the-suit configuration, and for Apollo, it didn't interface properly with the couches, number one, because of the envelope of the shoulder width and elbow width protrusion inside the couches and the fact that the Block I suit implementation was conducted before the G5C was developed. There was a timing difference between the, you know, The Block 1 is implemented during the time of the Gemini program, and the G5C came after the selection of the G4C or the G3C for the Block 1 program. They said they could don't pursue and go into shirts. But they were talking about 14 days of partial wear and four hours of pressurized wear. It was a tradeoff on shirts. It was a tradeoff. Unfortunately, the accident occurred and we never got any in-flight experience with that configuration for potential use later in the Block II Apollo program, which essentially became the Apollo program because Block II nomenclature disappeared at that point in time. Thank you."

I'm the Knowledge Capture Manager for SpaceSuits. And I welcome you all here today. But before we get started, I'd like to introduce you to both of them. Joe McMahon, his name is synonymous with SpaceSuits. He has spent 35 years years with NASA. Before that he graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering. He actually went off and worked for Liquid Carbonic for a couple years before he joined NASA. And after joining NASA he spent his entire career working spacesuits in some form or fashion. He was a project He was a technical manager, he was a test subject, and he did pretty much everything in relationship to the suits as well as MMU. His experience base covers Apollo, Gemini, Skylab, Shuttle, and of course the MMU to go with it. He has also authored a book, United States Space Suits, and if you haven't picked it up and looked at it or read it, I recommend that you do. just came out with a second edition of that book just here recently. Is it on, has it been released for publication yet, Joe? It will be November. November of this year. So I highly recommend it. It's a fabulous book about United States spacesuits. In addition to Joe, today we have Pekah Khan with us. And Pekah has been a writer, photojournalist, producer, all the way from journal articles in Houston Chronicle to doing production for BBC. She's also co-authored several books, one about cultures and living in different cultures. Soft Homes, Soft Hearts. It's a wonderful book. She also has traveled the world internationally and done many different things. She's had a small business, she's a realtor, you name it, she's very talented. I just wanted to add one thing that I bet Cinda doesn't even I was the first reporter to write an article on the space station when it was renderings. And everybody said, well, this is a joke. This will never happen. This is Star Trek. So my interest and my admiration truly for engineers, like my little boy says, Mama, you have no left brain. Let me do it. I really admire everything that you are doing and contributing, and I just think it's fabulous. I've always covered NASA because I love it. So I was so honored to know Senda personally and professionally, and to know Joe. We're all honored to be in his presence. He not only has worked in spacesuits for 40 years, but he is a brilliant storyteller, and he really brings the industry to life. I think that's one of his greatest accomplishments, besides his book that will be translated into Chinese this next time. So he is a wealth of knowledge. I would ask you to please jot down any questions. This is going to be a very interactive piece. We're going to start with a little icebreaker. Over here I'm going to ask you a couple of questions, or Joe will start, and then he will present his PowerPoint along with stories. And then at the end you can actually ask him and have a dialogue with him. So I'm going to do this little icebreaker. We're going to do it quickly, quickly. And Joe's going to tell you what we're going to do. So first of all, let's welcome Joe McMahon. Joe McMahon Well, thank you. Whether you know it or not, you're giving me the most valuable thing you have, your time. You can't save time. You can't make time. You can only use it. And I hope today, my expectation is that someday, somewhere, you'll say, oh, yeah, that's what he meant when you hear something that I've said here today. The whole object is that the laws of physics worked for Wiley Post back there, 1933. They worked for me all through my career. They're going to work for you. So some of the stuff we're going to be talking about happened before you were born, but it's still relevant today. And hardware always does what you tell it to do. Sometimes you don't realize what you told it to do. People, on the other hand, seldom do what you tell them to do. And there are laws governing that. They don't make a lot of sense sometimes. But what I've learned over the years is that if you're conscious most of the time, you can start picking up some of this stuff. I was young once, as you can see from the front page. I was with Liquid Carbonic back in 1960. My job was to make the second visit with the salesman after he made the first visit to the guy and convinced him that liquid oxygen or liquid nitrogen or whatever else we were selling could solve his problem. My job turned out to be letting him down easy, that he was probably doing it the best way he could do it anyway, and to hopefully not make him so mad that the salesman couldn't get back on the property again. After a couple years of that, I decided to go with NASA. I took $1,100 a year cut in pay. Went from $7,500 to $6,435. But I was young and single. I mean, what does it matter? When I joined NASA, I got involved in ops. In those days, everybody smoked. That was a Dutch master's panatella in there during the Gemini program. I also did some suit testing back when I had more hair and redder hair. was a subject for about 17 years until I got the bends twice and it kind of washed me out, which is probably a good thing. What's happening to you every day is that you're learning things. I don't necessarily realize that you're learning things, but you are kind of a sponge soaking up things. I'm at age 74. Each day is a much smaller percentage of my life than it is of your life at a much younger age. even the guy born in 47 it's it's it's still so that's why as you get older time seems to go rush by so faster your brain is still trying to accommodate all those uh previous years so what i've what i've noticed too late for me is that certain things keep recurring certain patterns happen and so i've noticed i've just kind of break them into people and hardware i call them laws. Actually, there's one law, and it's just, it's McMahon's law of the innate cussedness of people and things. I mean, Murphy's law is just a subcontext of that law. It's hardware and people. Now, software, I don't deal with software. Software is like hardware and drag. I mean, I don't really know how to deal with software. So some of the same The same things apply, though. Pika, you want to? Well, I kind of wanted you to go into some of the early during the test suits, early test suits. What are some of the things that you can remember that we won't say failed, we will just say became another step to success? Well, to me, I think that the worst thing that can happen to you is to have good luck early in your career because then you start"

What are some of the things that you can remember that we won't say failed, we will just say became another step to success? Well, to me, I think that the worst thing that can happen to you is to have good luck early in your career because then you start to expect it. You get arrogant. I mean, it's just human nature. You have a hubris, you know. So especially in the early days of Gemini, I mean, everything I needed to know I learned in the Gemini program over about two years. I came into the program and started overrunning immediately. And we couldn't buy a successful test. We couldn't buy a successful flight until the very end. So I learned everything about how to screw up a program and put it into practice and had to live with the results. So Senda was going through all the things I've done. I've screwed up everything I've ever been involved in. So hopefully, maybe I've learned something from that. So if you do it different than I did it, you usually got a better chance for success than I did. So I've kind of learned some of the things. Some of the hardware designs, a design is always an estimate. It's somebody's idea of what it's going to take to work. And until something fails and you find out why it fails, you don't know how it works. Until then, you only know how the designer thinks it works. Nobody was more surprised than the EMU fan designer to find out after we had the SDS-5 debacle with the fan how those hall sensors really worked and how they got corroded and all that. He was just as amazed as anybody else. Do you think that part of that curiosity of finding the solutions is what makes a good engineer? Oh, yeah. You can't have too much curiosity. I did not have enough. I assumed things. I assumed that you could always trust policemen, lawyers, priests, and doctors, that they were somehow above everybody else. They were like daddy. you know and and and I carried that the fallacious belief a long time I was not curious enough I didn't ask enough wise and sometimes it's irritating to have people do that but I think curiosity and the satisfaction of that curiosity is one of the early keys one of the early indicators that that that somebody's gonna be a good engineer we'd like to make engineers with microwaves we'd like to put somebody in the microwave, I'll put it on high for 15 seconds so I'll have an engineer. Engineering is a crock pot science. You put them in, put it on low, throw in some wine, a little onion soup mix, put it in there, and you let it simmer because you've got to have time to make mistakes, live with the consequences of your mistakes, try and fix it, see if it worked, and you do this over and over. And you never learn it the first time. Human beings learn by iteration, by repetition. Somebody says, well, I don't like to make the same mistake twice. Hell, if I only made the same mistake twice, I'd be a genius. If I made it 40 times and due to something you hear today or next week, you only make the same mistake 20 times, that's progress. You know, I had a guy come up to me, hadn't seen me in a long time. We talked about this and that. He hadn't seen me with his beard. And he finally, we kind I ran out of things to talk about and he finally looked around and he said, well, Joe, I really hate to say this, you don't look so good with that beard. I said, I know, but I look better. We may never be able to be good, but we can sure as hell be better. Joe, can you tell us how important is teamwork, especially when you're working with suits? Oh, it's the answer. I am the world's worst team player because my ego needs to be continually fed. I have to feel like I can do everything. That's part of the reason I became a test subject. I want to be able to do it. Me, me, me. I like to make my own presentations. I can't hardly ever make anybody else's presentation. That's not the way things really get done. That's great if you're doing just a single project. But the best teams, you take contractor people, NASA people from different divisions, take their badges, throw them in a corner. And if you can't tell who's wearing what badge, that's a team. It's not that they don't have different functions, but that's a team. And everybody has their roles. There's three R's, roles, relationships, and responsibilities. Extremely critical to understand what those are. If you abdicate your role, as I've seen quality assurance do, as I've seen safety do, if you abdicate that role, then nobody else is doing it. So that way if you're safety and you're worrying about cost, who's worrying about safety? I got involved in the lithium battery program and I looked over a test series and I kind of charted it out. We started running this test and we had a strange odor. We kept running the test and this cell failed. Failed to meet its required amp hours. I found eight things on there that should have, whoa, called a halt. Somebody wrote a DR, investigate this. Nothing happened. I finally asked around why. Well, quality was subject to engineering. Oh, okay. So if quality was subject to engineering, who was doing quality's job? The answer was nobody. You can't trust engineers. I was an engineer, I know. Engineers, give me another pound. Give me another week. Give me another 500K and I'll have it. So managers learn not to trust engineers. I was an engineer, and I was a manager. And I knew I couldn't be trusted. Can you give us a specific example of where teamwork really helped in some aspect of the spacesuits? There's maybe a really big challenge, but because you came together as a group. The Gemini 4 system. The Russians went EVA. Leonov went EVA. and then on March 26, 1965, Jim Correale called a bunch of us into his office, and he says, Jiminy 4 is coming up in June. We want to go EVA. We had an IV suit. We had a chest pack that was planned for GT6, and he said, we want to go EVA on Jiminy 4, which was June 5th. This was March 26th. And we put a team together. You and you and"

We had a chest pack that was planned for GT6, and he said, we want to go EVA on Jiminy 4, which was June 5th. This was March 26th. And we put a team together. You and you and you. And I mean, we worked days, nights, weekends, whatever. And everybody, people hand wrote documents, red line drawings. Nobody cared about whose sandbox you were playing in. Everybody got there together. Same thing on the Skylab emergency. Two weeks of pure hell. We had people working together that wouldn't even talk to each other before. But when you have a common goal, when you have that focus, and you have dedicated, committed people, you can get anything done. Even I, as bad a team player as I was, got involved in that. So egos get in the way of teamwork. I had to harness mine and subjugate it in order to get things done. Because you can do a great job for one person, but what if it's not a one person job? Joe, you've said hardware always does what you tell it to. The problem is figuring out what you told it to do. The Challenger did exactly what it was supposed to do given the O-ring material, the J joint design, the temperature conditions, and we fell into the Challenger trap. NASA banged on Thiokol and said, prove to us it's not safe. Well, they couldn't do that. What they should have said was, prove to us it's safe. Columbia did exactly what it was supposed to do. The EMU when it burned on April 14th of 1980 and burned a tech over a third of its body. Destroyed a million dollars worth of hardware and cost the program ten million dollars. Did exactly what it was supposed to do. What we found out later was we had set up the perfect storm. We had a blind cavity, we had possibly some thin wall sections or some knife edges, we We had probably some contamination and we had a pneumatic ram, 6,000 PSI oxygen. So we set up the perfect storm and it did what it was supposed to do. We had had earlier warnings. That's the other thing is that a lot of times you get early warnings. People call them close calls now or near misses. You know, a near miss is a hit, right? I mean, I almost missed it. We had examples back in the Gemini program, a system I was responsible for, a check valve burned in 7,500 psi oxygen. Didn't hurt anybody, just caused the system to leak. We changed the valve out, cleaned things up. A few weeks later, we had another one burn down at the Cape. Took that, decided, well, we need probably a new check valve design. So we designed a new check valve. An oxygen purge system for Apollo blew up in the lab, injured a technician, destroyed the hardware, found out there was some sharp edges, some burrs, some contamination. So we fixed the individual problems, went along and fixed each individual problem. Didn't stand back and look for why are we having these problems? What is the root cause? Then on April 14th at 1.25 p.m. in the afternoon, in 1980 when we almost killed a guy, then we said, well, we better step back and look at this. So we came up with an oxygen specification that says how you design, how you test, how you select materials, how you clean for oxygen systems, for high pressure oxygen systems. Now, why did it take that long? We had the messages. The tire treads were across my chest from previous instances. Didn't learn. So we're talking about working with knowledge capture. This is part of the knowledge capture. Well, folks, there was knowledge not captured. So I am a poster child for knowledge not captured. So here's the thing. One thing, we cannot afford, the nation can't afford, NASA can't afford, nobody can afford for you to be educated the way I was. It's too expensive. You're going to have to be smarter earlier than I was. I'm smart now. I'm an expert in forensic science. I ain't worth a damn in preventative medicine. We do real good on failure analysis. What about failure prevention? Dirt foot. Do it right the first time. That's the message I want to try and get across. I'll be handing out copies of this thing because we're going to miss a lot of it. You spoke about testing, and I know you said be ready for the answer when you ask the question. Can you talk a little bit about the importance and maybe some of the struggles there have been with testing? How valuable that is? The time to do testing is really the far-reaching test is during development. You have the most freedom. Whether you realize it or not, you have the most time and the most money in development compared to what it's going to be like in the rest of your program. And the most important thing about testing is to find out what the margin is on your hardware because nobody knows tomorrow what they're going to want, but they're going to expect it. So the more margin you can find out your hardware has, the better off you're going to be. Now, you can't necessarily tell everybody about that margin. I had the two rules of design, you know, put in plenty of margin, but I better not be able to find it. If I'd have known the EMU, when I was back managing the EMU, if I'd have known that EMU was going to be good for 25 EVAs instead of the required three EVAs, EVA's I would have probably made them take out whatever it was that was contributing to that. If I'd have known it was going to be good for 30 years instead of 15 years, I wouldn't have stood for that. If I'd have known it could go 8 and a half hours instead of 7 hours like the requirement says, I would have thought myself a good boy if I'd have taken out that capability. Luckily, Hamilton was smarter than I was and built it in. And that's why we're still being able to use that EVA today, that EVA system today. The testing that you do in development, if you know what you tested, the configuration, and how that configuration relates to what you want to fly, if you can say what you did, exactly what you did, exactly what you found out and what it means, that data is valuable from now on out. And if you want to make sure that you do, you get the quality guy, I know this is not a quality control test,"

They're more likely to help you than you are if you want to ram it down their throat later. You may be able to do that once, but they're waiting in the weeds for you next time. You want allies, you don't want adversaries. Get people to get invested in what you want to do. That way they have to end up defending along with you when people work together and for change to make changes is there a fear of going too quickly of moving maybe not quick enough how do you deal with that all changes have a bad side no matter what how noble your ambitions are or your intentions or how you plan all changes have a negative side what you hope is that the negative side is much smaller than the positive side that that you're going after. And one way to look at changes is that, okay, I don't need to do anything. Well, and you make people justify everything you want to change. The other way is to say, I want to make all these changes and then come down. You'll never get to the same place. The problem with bundling changes is that something that you don't really have to have can end up pacing the thing that you do have to have. Or a problem with that can right at all. The 3000 series glove was supposed to be the answer to our glove life problems. We had a 42 man pressurized hour glove in the 1000 series. The 2000 series I won't even talk about it. It didn't last long enough to see the light of day. So we came up with the rucathane bladders good for 468 man pressurized hours versus the 42 that we had with the old neoprene. While we, so the obvious thing is I changed the bladder material to the rucathane and go with it. But along with that, we said we can get some more thumb easement and we can change the way we adjust the length of the fingers. The crew is kind of complaining about the procedure to change the finger lengths and all that. We can change that. Well, made those gloves, the 3000 series gloves, flew them. Jerry Ross came back with a numb thumb for about two weeks. All the crew is complaining about sore finger crotches and all that. By By the way, we got the 468 hours, but nobody remembered that. All they remembered was these lousy gloves make my thumbs numb and my fingers hurt. So we didn't have to make those other changes, but we went ahead and bundled them in anyway. It seemed like a good idea at the time. I'm not saying don't do it, but be aware that when you do that, you're laying yourself open for risk. And you have to ask yourself when you're contemplating any change, any change, what happens if I don't make this change? And if you judge the change on the basis of, well, this is a safety issue, you've got to really watch that because then somebody says, you mean we've been flying unsafe all this time? So watch out for that trap. And have data that supports your change. The best words I ever heard from a manager were, don't tell me, show me. It's easy to arm wave and talk about all this stuff. Show me data, like that sign they used to have over the mirror. And God we trust, all others bring data. What would you say has been the greatest change in spacesuits over the years that has really made a huge difference to the success of the suit? Well, gloves are always changing. So I can't say that, I think the latest gloves, if they're still working on Phase 6 gloves, that's certainly a step increase and it's been a gradual thing and I don't think it will ever be through changing gloves. The biggest change that we made in suits was going from essentially custom suits in Apollo which were body fitted. I walked into the building 7 restroom area back there and Mike Collins was standing there holding this bar and he had a full body cast, plaster of Paris cast over his entire, they They were taking a cast to make a suit. So we advanced from that to Jim Correale's dream, which was bins of parts, heart upper torsos and arms and legs and all that that you could mix and match and make them fit and to get rid of the exposed hoses. He saw the astronauts falling on the moon and said, we will never have a suit with exposed hoses again. And that's funny. We were worried in the early days of Apollo, the one or the first criterion for the suit and backpack system was that you'd be able to get up off your back in a 1-6G environment. So they flew 1-6G plane parabolas, put people on their backs, had them try and get up. And that's what kind of designed it. So we always thought that the problem was going to be falling on your back. The problem was falling face forward because we didn't know what it was going to look like on the lunar surface. We did all this practicing, and yet when they got on the lunar surface, they did this lope, and it was bounding up in the air. So always be alert for surprises. So I think going to the mix-and-match parts of the suits was probably the biggest thing, and going to a hard upper torso and getting the suits more rugged was probably the biggest change that I saw. Because Apollo suits, the bladders died, and just the whole reusable aspect. We left the Apollo primary life support systems on the lunar surface. Now we reuse them over and over and over. So I think that's been the greatest thing is to be able to mix and match sizes and reuse. What effect do you think the new spacesuits that are attached to the back of the rover where you just basically jump in them and go, what kind of impact is that going to have on the future? That's going to put a whole new series of challenges forward. But the very fact that if we're going to be on asteroid surfaces or Martian surfaces or even back on the lunar surface, the challenges are going to be less access, less the whole business of being able to send up hardware and change it out or get the hardware"

But the very fact that if we're going to be on asteroid surfaces or Martian surfaces or even back on the lunar surface, the challenges are going to be less access, less the whole business of being able to send up hardware and change it out or get the hardware back in a timely fashion to re-services. All that goes out the window. So ruggedness and reliability and hopefully simplicity are going to be the answers to that. And the temptation, especially in the world of electronics where you have all this capability, the temptation is to make things more complicated than they have to be to get all this flexibility that you may or may not need. On the other end of the scale, single point designs usually can be made more rugged and more reliable, but they're not flexible. If your design point ends up being different, then you're operating off-normal. You're operating in a region maybe that you're not really designed to operate. Again, another reason for having margins. So you earn your money by figuring out how much complexity and flexibility you need, how much you can afford. how do I back up all these things that could go wrong, especially if I'm depending on them. For example, you're going to depend on the CO2 sensor now to control how your carbon dioxide removal system works. We never had that before. The CO2 sensor was just there to tell you maybe if it had broken through or whatever. It was not a control function. Now it's part and parcel of the actual operation of the system. That's a big change in philosophy from what we've had in the past. What would you like to see in the future for the spacesuits? Well, this is probably heresy, but I think a good hard suit, something that's rugged and reliable, something along the lines that have been talked about for years, would be great to have if we're really going to do many, many, many EVAs on a planetary or heavenly body surface. If we're not, then you get into problems just as they're facing now and trying to make one suit do a number of things that are grossly different like launch, entry, and abort and also have that suit be mobile enough for EVA. That's really a challenge. You know, they were using, one of the papers out at this conference talked about using cadavers to find out the the uh bruise points from the heart hard joints of the suit wouldn't it be neat if you could use zombies because then you could test them and then you then you could interview them after you were done but i think there's a whole new area of technology we could explore what about development how important has that been to you personally throughout your career Well, what's been more important was the lack of it. In shuttle, we went in and said we need a development unit. We're trying to justify our cost to headquarters. We need a development unit because we want to make sure that we can go ahead and test it that will give us a lot of assurance that we can go through our CERT without any problems. And headquarters said, we think you guys are better than that. We don't think you need a development unit. The orbiter doesn't have a development unit, which is debatable. So we think you can go right for a cert. So we went right for a cert unit, which meant controlled hardware, under change control, and we ended up flooding it, it ended up failing. So we had a development unit. And I will say this, you will have a development unit. You may not call it that, but you will have it. So we had, I remember at one point in the valve module, we had 25 repairs on the old aluminum valve module. Think of the guy that had acne. It's horrible looking. Because we were essentially developing our hardware using the CERT unit. Tremendously costly, tremendously inefficient. Besides, the development unit is useful later on when you want to try something different and you don't want to risk one of your CERT units or your production units. We know that backup systems are very important. Can you tell us in some way that you remember where the backup system really ended up being a saving device? Well, luckily in the shuttle program, we never had to end up going on our secondary oxygen pack. The closest we came I think was STS-51I when Van Hoften went out for his second EVA and no one had changed out his canister. So he was going out with an expended canister we thought. However there was enough margin in the canister he was able to go like 10 hours. The CO2 was rising as he came back in. He was almost ready to pull a purge valve but he didn't. So I, in fact I had one guy who shall remain nameless early in the program, he was an intern first and he ended up going to headquarters, which was probably a good place for him. He wanted to get rid of the OPS, or the SOP, excuse me, in shuttle, the SOP. You never use it. That's great, but you know, what's wrong with this picture? We never have had to use it, but, and let's see, the Gemini system we didn't use it, but it's always there. You're always glad it's there. It's the only reason really that you, the suit and life support system is like a a 2-1-R system, it's one failure tolerant and then you go on the emergency system. We would have never, and even, we even have some failures that we can't really design for. We just have to say that hey there's enough margin in the design, we tested enough that it isn't going to happen. The suit and life support system gets a lot closer to the edge than other systems that life critical on the on the orbiter or another spacecraft. Your little piece of fabric is between you and and death. We've had instances where a backup system would have been helpful the time that Jim Oblanc was hooked up to the chamber ECS and pulled one of the hoses off. His suit went to essentially zero before we could dive the chamber. So not having a backup system is not really a good idea. Well, it's so easy to hear your enthusiasm, and that's one reason that it's so wonderful to come to something like that with you. I'd like to know personally what has been the most exciting part of suits, making them work, the design, the implementation, seeing them in space. What have you personally really loved? I can't really pick one thing. I think that having been fortunate enough to be in on the design and being able to test every piece of hardware I ever was responsible for, I tested. An old division chief of mine wanted us to do"

An old division chief of mine wanted us to do that, and I think that's really good advice. If you can get into a suit, people who work on rocket engines, they're not going to really have the chance. chance but when you work with suits you're able to get in just pressurize above seal sea level understand what what the crew is going through that's been a very good one being over in the mission control during gemini was a whole different world it pointed out to me the difference between the world of just of just engineering and the world of ops of ops engineering the the the The fundamental thing about operations that I noticed was you always had to make your decisions based on what I considered insufficient data to satisfy my engineering side. You had to make the decision now. You're going to go or you're not going to go and you had to have some basis to make that decision on. And I had one guy that I'd put over there that could not function in that environment. He could not make a decision. I don't have enough information. Well, you have to make it. You have to make it on what you've got. I can't do it. So not everybody is suited to that ops mode. I don't think I was particularly good at it either. I got called to the front room one time. I was on console. And the flight director called me in with EECOM. And he wanted to know when this, this was, I was working ECS, the Gemini ECS. This was before we were doing the EVA stuff. He called me in and said, it was John Hodge. He says, I want to know when the tank is going to stop venting. I said, I think it will be about 6.15 a.m. He said, 6.15? How did you come up with that number? I said, because I go off shift at 6. I thought it was a little humor. You know, it never hurts. Oh, yeah, it did hurt. I said, in other words, you don't know. I said, no, I really don't know. He said, I suggest you find out. I got on the phone with my boss and figured out an answer. A little humor is good in the right places. Again, another mistake. Was there ever a time when things got so difficult or so challenging that you just wanted to give up and not do it anymore? One time, not necessarily that, but I remember one time, again, during the Gemini program, Now you have to take yourselves back in time a little bit folks. I mean forget your smart phones, forget your dumb phones. Remember a phone, a dial phone that had the little. No they don't remember that. They had four lines. I can draw it I guess for you. We had four lines and I got a call from Dallas. One of my guys, Norm Prince, was in Dallas at LTV doing a thermal vac test of the chest pack and he had a problem. The lights got too bright or something. It essentially sunburned the Velcro on the front of the pack. What were we going to do? While he's talking to me, the second line rings. I put him on hold. I answer the second line. It's Marshall Horton calling from St. Louis. We've got a problem with the altitude chamber test that we're doing there. while i'm talking to him the third line rings i put him on hold norm is still on hold this is travis brown calling from the the cape we got a problem with the unit down at the cape then the fourth line rings i put those three on hold ken ken uh snyder from the test branch ec4 is calling we're getting ready to do a chamber test we got a problem there i put him on hold i just kind of stood there and these lights are going answer me answer me i finally just had to get my pulse right down and just start taking them one by one and that's just that's just the way it was you know so i'd say that was and i survived it you know that's i i think i learned some things from it but the first thing you have to do is survive and not everybody is suited for this work we used to have this little fixture that was to to demonstrate how much better Lexan was for impact resistance than a plexiglass. So this was a little board. It had two hemispherical dishouts, had a little bracket. You slid a sheet of plexiglass on one side and a sheet of Lexan on the other side and had a little ball-peen hammer. So you'd take that hammer and you'd shatter the plexiglass and you'd beat on the Lexan. And of course, it would just barely put a little dent in it. So we We used that for years. I don't know how many sheets of plexiglass we went through. But the other side started to cold work down into that hemispherical. Pretty soon you couldn't pull it out. I kind of look at that as an analogy to some of the people we have. You're in this business. Are you a sheet of Lexan or are you a sheet of plexiglass? A lot of times when it came, the ball peen came down and the guy would shatter. a lot of people leave. Could not or would not take it. The rest of us managed to stay. When you hear other people talk about some of the same things I talk about, you get some of the same answers. Why? Because we were beat into shape by the same forces. You end up coming to some inevitable conclusions if you're conscious most of the time. So I think what happened was I learned just about everything I ever learned in the Gemini program. The years after that were just repetitions things came around in different guises but once I realized what had happened I realized it's the same damn thing I just I just missed it so what you want to do over your career is you develop your gut you develop this instinct when certain sets of conditions come up with people or hard or whatever you say this sounds familiar this feels familiar and once you start developing and that's where the crock pot comes in that's you have to oh yeah I've been I've been down this road before. If you can learn to recognize that, they look different coming at you. When they go by you, you realize it's the same damn thing again. I just missed it. What three attributes would you say have helped"

What three attributes would you say have helped you and maybe would help others in this industry that you really have to have to be successful in this industry? Well, I don't know how successful. I mean, first of all, you've got to live. My father died at 62. My brother died at 59. I'm 74. So first of all, you know every day is a it's a blessing every day is a gift as far as I'm concerned With my family history, but I think you've got to have discipline You got to do what needs to be done because it needs to be done. You got to have integrity You've got to answer the question that was asked and also the question that should have been asked And you got to put margin in things And you got to be it's more than three you got to be dependable You gotta be somebody that your boss can depend on. I can go to Jim or I can go to Joe or whoever it is and I know they're gonna give me the answer. I don't have to worry about doing their job for them. That's every manager's fear. If he or she doesn't do it, I gotta do it because it's all gotta appear level to my boss. If there's valleys, I've gotta fill them in. If there's hills, I gotta chop them off. If I can rely on the person to do their own work, maybe do a little more than is required, that's good. Then I can do my job. I don't have to do it. That's every manager's worries. I'm going to have to do your job and mine. You really can't do both. So if I'm doing your job, who's doing mine? So I think be dependable. Be somebody that's there, always there, always comes through. Doesn't make promises they can't keep. That's the other thing. Sometimes you have to push back. Boss will give you a date. present I want this by such-and-such you know it's impossible but he gave you the day or she she gave you that sometimes you need to gently but firmly push back is this really hard to because I can do it but I won't give you the complete answer or I won't be able to do this other thing you know what's more important of these these two you know tell me give me some sometimes it's just a date they picked out of the air sometimes it's not you can bend your needle you can kill yourself working for a date that's not that's not really real and you miss it, and the boss says, well, if you don't say anything, they depend on you to do it. I got sent out on a job before I went with NASA. The job was poorly planned. It was terrible. I made the terribly wrong assumption was, when I got out there, I knew I couldn't do it. But I assumed that since my boss knew me and he sent me out there, I must be able to do it. So I must not be trying hard enough. He didn't know. I didn't say anything. So if I didn't say anything, he assumed I was doing it. So it fell on its face along with me. How important has failure been in this industry? I was known for two things in my career with NASA. One was running without a shirt in all kinds of weather and the other was failures. and he became almost synonymous with a failure. They say, you know, failure is how you learn. And that's really true. And they say, you know, we encourage you to try, and it's okay if you fail. Bull. It's never okay if you fail. But if you don't get out front and at least try something, you're going to have to be able to live with failure, your own personal failure. I asked my boss, Don McMoneagle, when he took over the EVA office, first in his class at the Air Force, astronaut, mission specialist I think, pilot, commander, everything, head of that EVA office. And I said, Don, have you ever failed at anything? He said, oh, yeah, there's a lot of stuff I haven't been able to do. I said, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, have you ever had something for which you were personally responsible, it was your baby, and it fell on its ass? He said, no, I don't think I really have. And that's scary because you know what? It's out there. It's waiting. The really big one is away. So failure makes you humble. It really ought to. When I sat across from that tech that was burned over a third of his body for a system that I was responsible for, I didn't want anybody in this room to have to do it. You have knowledge and you have realization. I haven't told you anything this morning, nothing that you didn't know. You knew it intellectually. You may not realize it Everybody knows the smoking can lead to lung cancer the guy that's been diagnosed realizes So the bridge between knowledge and realization is experience My experience has done this if your experience can do this based on something. I've told you here. That's better That's that's progress. So I Don't want anybody here and have to relive some of the experiences that I've had in order to learn to get that realization that I've got which for me is too late but it's not too late for you you said that it's crucial in the it what's crucial is a recovery plan from a failure and you have five parallel elements did you talk about those a little yeah but I was sitting at a meeting one day after this after I'd left NASA was working for Hamilton we were on a telecom with the Hamilton plant and was a guy on there and he was going over How you set up? the elect the the inputs for a computerized fault tree and Have the things you could say and the things you couldn't say and all the interest The intricacies of this of this program now I can see the people around me going They were just dying. You know here. We had this big failure working There it was coming down on us, and he was worried about that and it suddenly dawned on me that what was really important here was how we how do we get back how do we get back to op to operating and it's suddenly dawned on me that although we usually ended up doing the right things we ended up doing everything we needed to do we didn't"

Second was figure out a way to support your next exercise, whatever it is, whether it's a flight, whether it's a test, whether it's a launch, whatever it is. Third thing was how are you going to operate in the interim before you find out the root cause and corrective action? And maybe that's the same answer as how do I satisfy the next use? Fourth thing is finding root cause and corrective action. And the fifth thing is, what's my backup? What if none of this works? What's my backup plan? The thing was, one of the things that just came to light, we had contamination in the interstage of a secondary oxygen pack. Hydrocarbon contamination. Well, that says every SOP is suspect. I said, wait a minute. It's coming from the oxygen. We filled the plisses. Well, all the plisses are suspect. So all our plisses are SOPs. We started going, wait, wait, how about the crew escape packs? We don't know what oxygen system is bad. What about the orbiter? So we had to go notify everybody that, you know, in the world of legal issues, you're innocent until proven guilty. In the world of hardware failures, you're guilty until proven innocent. You get everything, training hardware, anything that interfaces that could have been affected, affected and then you gotta start weeding them out, figuring out which ones are left. We ended up changing the oxygen charging system over to the Fepec, we had to put in a coal trap, that's where we were getting it. We were getting an accumulation of hydrocarbons which we ended up freezing out. But you need to start all these things at the same time and that's resource hungry. The guy's not going to necessarily work on a backup plan that may never be used, but if you need it, you need to turn around and it's there. It's ready. And the only way that happens is somebody's working it. And as far as finding root cause, just like I talked with the oxygen system, many times we stop short of finding root cause. Root cause is the defect in or omission of some process that controls not only the system you're working on, but the other systems under the control of the organization. They always give the example of the washing machine. It quits, and it's because the motor quit, and the motor quit because the bearing burned out, and the bearing burned out because it wasn't lubed, and it wasn't lubed because the work instruction wasn't right. So, ah, the root cause is the work instruction. No, the root cause is the process that controls work instructions. I can fix it for the washer. what about the dryers? What about the martini mixers? What about the other things that this company builds? So you need to go. People stop too short. And you know, I'll tell you the test you give, the litmus test you give when you've reached root cause is when you piss off your management. You know you've gotten there. Here you are, you're going to criticize this system. It's been working great, but you found a flaw in it. And you found a flaw that's going to affect not just your system, but these other systems over here. I'm going to have to change something now. Because if I'm not, if I don't change it, I'm just waiting for something else to happen. So that's the thing about root cause. Backup systems, you want to be as different from your system that failed as possible. We ended up using Orlons on orbit because when our systems were down for water contamination. Oh, killed everybody's ego to use them. But hey, they were totally different interface with the space station than we had. Most of the work that you do is in a lab, an office, wherever. Although its true success rate is not of this city world, when you go into outer space, it's tested by the crew. How much collaboration is there between the crew and the engineers before it's figured out in the engineering space? Do you take suggestions from them? Do you work with them in any kind of collaborative way? If you want to survive, you do. Yeah, we're much better, I think, now than we used to be. We're first putting the Gemini system together, the ELSS, X-ray Correlation Support System. We want to have a warning tone. So we said what's a good warning tone? So we picked I think 1500 cycles, 1500 Hertz. Well it turned out a lot of the crew had dropouts from being exposed to jet engine noise. They had a dropout in that range. They said how's that warning tone? What warning tone? You know so yeah you have to get the crews input. The thing is about the crew, the thing is about designing for the crew though, engineers are homed in on their system and I talked about that in here is it for an engineer that's that's conversant with his system it's no trouble at all him to say turn valve a read gauge B unplugged connector C and whistle the theme from Titanic you know multiply that by several hundred systems and the crew is doing nothing then but shucking and jiving taking care of what really are deficiencies in the design that's That's why it's so important to get the user perspective of your system in development or use or whatever. I had a guy in the Skylab world worked up for research and he designed the composite connector that made the two cooling lines and the oxygen line and the electrical connector to the pressure control unit. This guy was a very precise individual. He was bald before bald was fashionable. His head was neatly trimmed. His desk was precisely arranged. His coffee cup was in the exact center of its coaster. All the papers were arranged. The pencils were arranged in order. He smoked and everything. I say even the ashes from the cigarettes were lined up. Everything was precise. And he had in the precise center of his desk the prototype for the LSU connector for life a support system connector. He was very proud of it. It had a double locking feature which was the key thing. You don't want the thing coming open so you have a lock on top of a lock. I said, well this looks good Bruce. His name was Bruce Gray. This"

You don't want the thing coming open so you have a lock on top of a lock. I said, well this looks good Bruce. His name was Bruce Gray. This looks good Bruce. So I took it, put it about where it would be on the belly pack, went over to his file cabinet and started beating on it. Beating on the file cabinet. I thought he was going to have a heart attack. This was his baby. He designed it. He built it. He watched over and there I was beating the crap out of it trying to get it to open. And it didn't open. I said, hey, this is good. He said, why did you do that? I said, you think the crew's going to leave it on their desk? So you have to, if the crew's going to use it, it's going to be abused. So it needs to be able to take that. The crew needs to not even know it's there. That's the greatest compliment you can get from a crewman is they don't even realize your system's there. It's great. Has there been any kind of instance that you specifically remember without that feedback from the crew, it would have been a failure. Let's see. Some people in this room probably know that better than I do. Well, I was at one of the debriefings. Oh, so this is a setup, huh? No, no, no. It's not, but I was struck by a little girl. She was about eight, and she said, is there anything you would like to see changed about the spacesuits? and one of the astronauts said something about the gloves. They weren't tactile enough or something. And I thought, you know, I wonder if anyone ever thought to ask him that except an 8-year-old because it's such a simplistic question. So I wondered about that. Yeah, gloves, you do get feedback from the crew, sometimes unintentional. Jay Aft on the flight, we had the palm bar actually punctured the bladder and punctured his hand. So we had, I guess maybe his blood helped seal the hole. So we got feedback there that we needed to redesign that palm bar. And gloves, of course, I talked about the 3,000 glove and the extra easement that we put in that we ended up taking back out. The thing is, sometimes enthusiasm gets in the way of practicality. When the Phase VI glove first came out, and the crew tried it in the NBL, I mean, they were in love with it. It was built essentially first as an APSI glove, and then we used it, and they loved it. And so, okay, we want to work this into flight. So I asked Hamilton what it cost to get this in a flight. And we finally came up $200,000. $200,000. I said, well, on the basis of that, I'll sign the change. Ended up costing us $1.2 million. To change the glove? Change the glove for the whole program. We had some failure modes we hadn't counted on, which got pointed out to us. So we had to increase this, increase that. and we ended up putting it into service before we should have, before it was through certification, and so we had some failures, we had to go back. So, you know, it's sometimes your enthusiasm to make this change gets in the way of what it really takes to make the change work. Anytime people tell me, I want you to think out of the box, think out of the box, okay, what does that really mean? What is the box? The box is structure. Somebody doesn't like the structure that you're in. That's supposedly keeping you from doing something that you want to do. I want to think outside that structure. Well making the revolution is easier than making the revolution work. If you think outside this box you better start thinking into some other box because you need structure to be able to carry on a program. You got to have a system in place if you want to violate the system and everybody does at some point in time you're going to violate the system. If you don't have a system, if you're operating in panic mode all the time, then you can't, there's nowhere to go. So you always want to have a system and a way around the system. I had, I made a deal with my boss when I worked over in the orbiter and GFE office. He has a change board. He would sign all the changes. And I said, Clay, let me sign anything on the EMU that I think I can. and if you decide I've signed something inappropriate, you can take it away from me. And he, okay, he agreed. So what I did was we had a stamp we put on them where you had to get SR and QA, the medical people, the crew, MOD, everybody to sign off. So I would make this, I'd get this change typed up, put that stamp on it, and I would hand walk it around, all these guys, and I would sell it. Bring it back, sign it, put it into play, attach it to the agenda for the next change board so anybody could overturn it they come through and maybe srnqa say hey we don't agree with that change but I already got an srnqa to buy in on so if the guy wanted to buy we've got one to change it that meant he was over over overruling his his person that I'd already talked to so I found a system around the system now the key is you can have the same amount of discipline in your informal system as you do in the regular system. So it's sometimes it boils down to a question of format rather than content. People get hung up on format rather than content. We were doing our at we had our failure modes of effects analysis and critical item list for the shuttle EMU. So Space Station came along going to use shuttle EMU on Space Station. They said we need your FEMA cell. I said oh okay here it is. No no no no no wrong format. You have to put it in Space Station format. said okay we got a bid on that it was a million plus and we would still have to keep the shuttle one going because that was shuttle program we finally finally convinced them you can use it but people are so hung up on format it's the content that you that you really worry about you get past the format arguments how difficult is it to introduce a new system when you're replacing in an old one? Well, the first thing that hits you is that you"

Well, the first thing that hits you is that you've got a marching army in place that supports the old system. Now I want to bring in a new system. Okay, I still got to keep the old one going long enough to get the new system past the point of maximum risk that I can feel confident I can take the old system out and phase it out. So for some period of time, you're going to have two marching armies. One with your old system, one with your new system. And the benefiting organization has got to pay for those. So there's got to be a real payoff for going to this new system. Or else they're going to say, why should I change? That was part of the argument against the new EMU for space station. They said we want to do 12, excuse me, we want to do 4 sets of EVAs. We want to do 12 EVAs. Well we were only good for three EVAs before we had to have ground servicing so that would mean four sets of hardware. We said well wait a minute we're just certified, that doesn't mean we can't do it. We're just certified for that. So we went out and recertified. People hated that idea because Lockheed wanted to get on in the business, Allied Signal wanted to get on in the business and here we were going to pump up Hamilton again. But to pay for a new EMU development was at least $300 million right off the top just just to start plus you're going to have to keep the old one going until the new one could take over. So and what happens if some problem happened with the new one? Then you'd have to use the old one anyway. So when you start a new program then it's a lot easier. Trying to phase a new system into an existing program is really really difficult for no other reason just because of the cost. Was there any time when that really became a problem and you really had a difficult time bringing in the new one? You just got so much resistance? Well, we had, we wanted to bring in a regenerable CO2 removal system for a space station. The logistics of using expendable lithium hydroxide was just out of the question. So we had two competitors, Hamilton and Allied Signal, or Honeywell. And Hamilton ended up winning it, and it would have been really interesting if Honeywell would have won it, because we would have been introducing a competitor system right into the heart of the EMU. So we didn't have to do it, but I often wonder how well we would have worked. And let me tell you what it gets down to. It gets down to the people side of the equation. The hardware you can make work, always. It's what are the people going to do? What is the company posture? What are the personalities of the people involved? If you read this U.S. spacesuits book in the early days of Apollo, the overwhelming impression you get is how much influence the personalities of some of the people at NASA and ILC and Hamilton had to do with how well the program was or wasn't running. It's amazing how much influence people have. You'd like to think physics is physics and data is data and it's a zero or a one and I can go from there. Not when there's people involved. Yeah, people, that always changes the situation. And people respond you say in two primary motivations which are? Fear and greed. An old boss had told me that. People respond to two things, fear and greed. We went to the moon not for science. to the moon out of fear the Russians were going to get there. That's why we went to the moon. Science was essentially secondary. Now they're trying to get the private sector involved in space. You've got to appeal to greed. Where's the money? Show me the money. That's going to be what you hear. So if it's just the government paying industry to go out in space, then that's not a lot different than where we are now. So it's got to be something And it's not just taking some sheiks and rich CEOs up in space. There's got to be something out there that's big enough and permanent enough to justify. And it isn't just satellites. So there's got to be something. If we're really going to bring space to a commercial level, there's got to be something out there, some reason to do it. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe you all know better than I do. Wouldn't surprise me. What is Strutman's law? Stutzman's law Stutzman's law sorry, there's Three three things there's cost Schedule and technical performance. It's a three-legged stool Legs got to be the same length You can control at best two out of those three and they drive the third I Remember in the early days of space station freedom. I was over at the Hamilton building us out there and a guy that worked for MacDac Came out to take a smoke break and he was really whining. And I said, what's the matter? He said, well, they want a double keel station. They want it in orbit by 1984 and want it to cost $8 billion. So they fixed all three. He said, I keep telling them, you can have the double keel. You can have it by 1984, but you can't have it for $8 billion. Or you can have something for $8 billion by 1984, but it won't be a double keel. You can't fix all three. Now people that are able to do that are only able to do it because somewhere they hit some margin in one or more of those legs to make them come out equal. Now you can measure a lot more things than that. People talk about all the metrics you can do. You can, but why? Those are the only ones that are important. You measure those. That'll tell you how well you're doing. You take cost or resources, you spread them over time, and you get a product. That's it. Cost plus or resources plus time equals a product and they are locked locked together How important is optimism in this kind of work you got to start out When you're young Particularly, you know, I'm pretty cynical as you can tell from some of the stuff, but I've earned it It take me 50 years. I've earned my level of cynicism. Don't you adopt my level of cynicism earn your own? own."

I've earned my level of cynicism. Don't you adopt my level of cynicism earn your own? own. Start out pretty idealistic because the entropy of idealism, it rises. You will lose it inevitably. In order to be able to lose it, you better have a bunch of it to start. And there are a lot of good things. One thing you want to do, or at least that I want to do is make my job fun as much as I could. Find a way to have fun. You wouldn't think award fee board reports could ever be fun. But I was on an award fee board committee. I was a committee chairman. I went over to the project office. I became an award fee board chairman. So I had essentially, and again, I wanted to do everything myself, I wrote the report. Now the report would go through my boss and it would go up to the ninth floor for Bill Kelly, who was Abby's administrative assistant, and then it would go to Abbey. So one day, I mean, I'm kind of a wordsmith. I mean, I like to use words. So, and I don't know that this was the word, but this is an example of what I did. I put in something like, the contractor was Catholic in his approach to cost-saving measures, small c, which means universal. So I put that in there and sent it on to my boss, and he called me and he says, Mr. McMahon. I always knew I was kind of on the carpet when he said that. Mr. McMahon. He said, I thought I had you. I said, what do you mean? He said, I was reading the Ward Fee Report and used the word Catholic. I looked it up. Sure enough, it's right. He said, well, that was it. The game was on. After that, every Ward Fee Board Report, I would find some word to use in a little unusual. He would always find it. And we never heard a word from the ninth floor. Never heard a word. My dream, and maybe one of you will do this. In fact, I encourage you to do it if you don't mind risking your career, is take your Merriam-Webster or your dictionary, close your eyes, open it, and hit a word and find a way to use that in your next report. That's what I call having fun. It's kind of living on the edge a little bit. I mean, you've got to live on the edge a little bit. Another thing is that take acceptable risk. There's times to take risks. We're very risk averse. When I was getting ready to leave, and this is crucial to how much risk I actually took, I was within a couple of months of retiring. Award fee period was ending. Fred Burns was award fee board chairman for the FEPAC contract and I was for the EMU. And he caught me in the hall one day and said, oh, by the way, I just gave my award fee report to Abby and he's on the warpath. What about? Well, you remember STS-72, those hobo temperature recorders? The crew pulled out the leads. I said, yeah. He said, well, I told them feedback doesn't have anything to do with that. That was done over in Building 7. So I just thought I'd give you a warning. I said, oh, thanks. So I researched it. Sure enough, the crew had screwed up. So I said, well, maybe I'll get by with it. I go up there the day, and you don't go through the report line by line. You go through a presentation. So I had to cover STS-72 plant support and STS-72 field support. So I'm up there, and Brian Duffy had been the commander on that flight, and he was also now a deputy to George Abbey. I walk in the office, and he's not there. I said, ah, good, I'm going to skate. So I start talking, and I go through that, and everything is great. Abby's thumbing through the pitch. All at once, Brian Duffy walks in before I get to the field part. He sits down, and I think, well, I've got to go through it because it's on the damn chart. Like I said, yeah, an STS-72. All at once, Abby says, wait a minute, wait. That was your flight, wasn't it, Brian? Brian says, oh, yeah. Then I can see, oh, here it comes. I can see him doing it. He says, wasn't there something? Oh, yeah. Those temperature recorders, whose fault was that? Looked right at me. I said, well, I guess you've got to blame anybody. It was my fault. How was that? I said, well, I didn't leave the hardware with the crew for enough time for them to get adequately trained. He said, Abby looked around and he said, anyway, we can get somebody a salary for that? They all laughed. Hopefully they laughed. So we left. Don McMonigle, my chief, looked at me and said, you kind of fell on your sword there, didn't you? I said, think about it, Don. If I'd have blamed Sue Rainwater, who was heading up the training, she'd have had the knives drawn for you guys from now on out. I'm leaving in a couple months. What are they going to do? But if I'd have blamed her, you'd have never gotten over it. So whose fault it was, I don't know. So that was a minimum risk thing. Another time I was a Work Feed Board Chairman and we had given the contractor this fee for his work and a large part of the fee was based on some cost avoidance that he'd done. He really saved a bunch of money. This next period he saved us even more money. So I wanted to give him a higher grade. It would have meant about $4,000 fee. And the board did not agree with me. So I wrote a minority paper, a white paper. So when we got up to present to Abby, I presented the board's findings and I said, no, I have an opposing view. And so I presented my case for why you ought to get more. So Abby's answer was, well, we gave too much the first time. That's why we shouldn't give anything more. So I argued and argued. He finally gave"

He finally gave me one point, which was worth $2,000. So I got $2,000 out of Georgia Abbey and I don't know how many people in this room can ever say that. I know that part of the industry is always meetings, negotiations, contracts, things that you don't always want to deal with but need to. Can you tell us briefly how that all fits into it and what kind of attitude you have to have to go into that successfully? Well everybody hates contracts but you better have them. And people talk about, well, we'll have a gentleman's agreement on this. There are no gentlemen, believe me. I watched the contractor agree verbally with the JSC contracting officer, and it would be okay as long as his boss signed off on it. And they had done this in the past when he had a different boss. The guy didn't sign off on it. The contractor ended up having to eat a bunch of fee, and the contractor contracting officer took early retirement. So you need contracts, it needs to be written down. And the funny thing about negotiating is, everybody says, well you need to, everybody ends up giving up something and taking something. Let me tell you, there's ways to do negotiation. You gotta start from the same point. We had a negotiation with FIPEC one time. We told them we wanted to bid on 65 crew escape suits and a certain number of events and a certain number of spares and all that. came back with a proposal with 85 suits and so many more events and all that because they said hey we think you you're gonna need more than that so we started negotiating and they they gave up their 20 suits but they used that look how far we've come down and you tell little you've come come up yeah well they started from an inflated position so you got to start from a common ground also when you're doing things like incentives better agreed that the target is really the target and if you're above that you get more and if you're below that you get less. I argued for three days with the contractor one time and it finally came, what finally came out was what we considered the target they considered the best possible they could do. So we started about missing the target you know and oh they just they just came unglued and as far as about what we give you all this bonus if you exceed the target there was no way that they thought they could ever exceed the target. So we weren't talking the same way. So communicate. The other thing is that you get locked in. You're point people. You usually have a guy carrying the flag for your side and a guy carrying the flag for the other side. Those people can get locked up, submitted into their positions and they can't move. Loss of face, whatever it is. You need to have somebody above them on each side that's able to go and make the deal. Obama and Boehner violated that. He should have stuck with Biden and been able to come in at the last minute. Boehner should have had somebody, maybe Ryan, and then him be able to come in and cut a deal. Of course, he didn't have the backing of all his party. But that's the thing. And when you're only a few bucks apart, a few thousand apart on a million dollar contract, nobody wants to give. I'm going to lose face if I give. Come on, you know. I've seen contracts stall, a $5 million contract for $5,000. Come on. Get it done. Okay, I'd like to know, in wrapping it up, what propels you and what piece of advice can you give these young engineers to your best advice about the industry and suits and what you've learned in life? Well, the stuff, and we'll pass out copies of this thing. What I've learned doesn't just apply to suits. I mean, it applies to everything, to your personal life or whatever. The thing is, and it sounds trite, but be true to yourself. I mean, know what constitutes your own particular brand of integrity. What are your core values? And you stick with them. Whether you're that sheet of plexiglass or that sheet of Lexan, it doesn't really matter if you're really true. If space isn't right for you, then get out. If your job is not what you want it to be because of your boss or your coworkers or whatever, figure out what you can do to change you and make that job acceptable. Or if you can't do it or won't do it, then leave. When I left crew and thermal systems, I had made up my mind, If I don't get this job in the project office, I'm leaving anyway. I did not like where I was. I did not like what I was doing. And I wasn't about to change the rest of the world. All I could do was either change myself and live with it, which I decided not to do, or leave. But be true to yourself. If you've got core values, be true to them. Know what they are and be true to them. Whether you're in space or who knows what the future of NASA is going to be. back in 1975, they asked us, what do you want to see NASA do in the next 25 years? I put together this paper. It sounds like heresy now, but I'll tell you anyway. I said, I want NASA to morph into something called the National Technology Application Administration, NTAA. Space is a part of it, solving technical problems outlined for us by some blue ribbon presidential panel is our main thing. We have group A, B, and C centers. Group A centers work on 30-year problems. B centers work on 10 to 15-year problems. And group C centers are kind of the ops centers. JSC would be one of the group C centers. I put all this thing together and I sent it up through the chain. And I mean, My boss looked at it and said, I think this is a career limiting thing. I said, send it on anyway. George Lowe, I think he was deputy director or what, he scribbled a note. Oh, Chris Craft was center director. I still have a copy of his note. He said, I don't agree with this, but I'll send it on anyway. So I got a nice letter back from headquarters. So, but I, that's, that's what I really felt. And if"

And if it did limit my career, I guess, so be it. I was told one time if I wore a coat and tie, it would be better for my career. But after 73, when Nixon said government employees didn't have to wear ties anymore, I never wore a tie, except maybe on the ninth floor sometimes. I wasn't totally stupid. Thank you, Joe. Okay. Thank you. We have a couple of options. We can go ahead and answer some questions or you can flip through some of the charts. We didn't get a chance to flip through all the charts. I'll kind of leave it since we're going to give the charts out to them. Okay. And bearing in mind what you all asked for, which way would you all rather do it? You want to go through the charts or ask questions? You want to ask questions? Yeah. Okay. Ask away. I want to know, in your opinion, I know we've been doing low Earth orbit for a long time now. What do you think it's going to take for us to get where I think we should have been 10, 15 years ago? On the moon and on Mars? And beyond. Yeah. What do you think it's going to take to get us there? I have to say, here. If the Chinese decide to go after their heavenly palace, which they were supposed to do this year, but I haven't seen any sign of it yet, if they get serious about it, if we get afraid for some reason, if we feel like it's in our survival interest to do that, maybe that's a kinder word than fear, then I think we'll do something. Right now we're so fragmented, we're so unfocused in this country because we have so many things. We've got two wars going on, three if you count the NATO, thing over in Libya. We've got supposedly our economy problem, which I think is largely brought about by too much twittering and all. A large part of that is fear mongering. So we're so diffused. We've got so much political division that we can't focus. The key, how we got to the moon was focus unbelievable focus over over a period of time and well I either fear or just some if we if we perceive it's in our national interest to do it then we'll do it otherwise we won't do it for science we won't do it for adventure we won't do it because of the innate adventuresome spirit of man wanting to conquer new front frontiers a few people can do stuff like that but But the type of effort, and it's going to have to be, I think, an international effort. To go to Mars, to do anything really big on the moon, it's going to take some international effort. So I think it mainly, it'll be some fear of boring about either somebody else getting there first or eclipsing us in technology or whatever that basis of that fear is, I think that's going to have to motivate. It's got to somehow push some of these other stuff off the page. Otherwise we're going to be mired in these little wars for the foreseeable future. I hate to say it because I got a grandson just starting high school this year. I think that's just the way human beings operate. We do not operate in our own self-interest. We operate in what we perceive to be our self-interest. We don't necessarily operate in what is our real self-interest. I know I wanted to see us much further along in my lifetime and especially in my son's lifetime now that I have a grandson. I'd like to see us be in the things that we have imagined. I mean if it can be, I hate to bring up science fiction, but to me if it can be imagined, it can be done. Boy, hold on to that. That's great. I love to hear people talk like that because you'll operate from that basis. You're operating from that basis, which is good. You still have some optimism. It's tempered with the reality that you've seen, but you still have this hope, and I think that's what you've got to have is hope and operate accordingly. Anybody else? I got one. Yeah. Right now we're looking at exploration roadmaps. It's kind of the big exercise of the day. And we're investing a lot in support-related technology in those roadmaps. And I've heard it come up several times that we haven't thoroughly vetted 8 PSI and 32% oxygen. Did you have much experience testing in that regime? regime? Are we really hanging out as much as I think we are by basing our entire architecture on that? That's a good point, extremely good point, because if you're doing, to me I always have a problem with pursuing too many new paths at the same time that are interdependent without having a back up or back out position. The position. The suit port, I think you could make that work. The oxygen business, I don't know of a lot of data that we have at that regime. Of course, I've been out of the swim for a long time. If you have a suspicion, it means that there's something, at least from your viewpoint, lacking. And if you can't black in that square or fill that, then you need to start thinking about, well, what if this doesn't work? What if I find some pacing item that's going to blow my schedule out of water? Do I have a backup plan? I guess that's what I'm saying. For those things that you're worried about, do you have a backup plan? The thing that got me about those roadmaps that I saw was the lack of integration between the parallel paths, a lot of the stuff that looks like they were coming together with a suit and the life support some of the stuff coming together fairly late if you're going to fly them on the station. I think the earlier you can get the highest level of testing you can do, you got to do as soon as possible. Otherwise you're making assumptions about interfaces and assumptions are always wrong to some extent. The sooner you can do integrated testing in as good an environment as you can, the more answers you're going to find. That we are trying to do. Yeah, good. It hasn't happened. Any more questions?

I guess following up on that, is there a guideline or some type of way to figure out how much testing, you know, testing costs a lot and, you know, eventually you're going to be spending too much on the testing and not being able to do the flight. So at what point do you say that's enough testing? You're talking about development testing? This is, yeah, development and then follow up with actual testing of flight systems too. Yeah, the tendency is to be penny wise and pound foolish is to skimp on development testing, which I think is definitely wrong. You find out so much information in development testing, especially if you can prove it's close to what you're going to fly. In other words, if you pick a pretty late development unit to get that data, particularly the off off design data the margin find out the performance envelope what we used to call the squatch alloid you ever heard of the squatch alloid i was at a briefing one time over at marshall and the guy said well i'll stay inside the green scratchy lord we're going to be okay what the hell is this it turns out it's kind of a performance envelope as long as the launch vehicle stayed inside the green and it was an odd shape so so they just call it a Squatch-a-loid. I'd say, find out what your Squatch-a-loid is. So have you ever seen any programs do too much testing? I guess that just doesn't happen. No, no. I've seen some do some wrong testing, some dumb testing. Well, I have done, I have the record, the world's record. Guinness doesn't have a category, but if they did, I would be the clear winner. on the stupidest test ever run. Ever run. We were going to make the Apollo pad emergency air pack. A little 3,000 PSI system, five bottles in a little package, and it was going to be stashed outside on the arm, on the swing arm. If they had a problem in the command module, this is after they put in the quick opening hatch, the crew would get out of the hatch, run over, and you had to be able to put this thing on blindfolded because they would figure you had smoke. You threw it over your shoulder. you plugged in a relief valve to the outlet of the suit, you plugged in the inlet hose and turned it on, you got a five minute purge system and you get on the slide wire and you go on down. Okay, this was the PEEF, pad emergency air pack. So we were trying to find bottles and so we had these bottles that were rated at 1800 PSI but the contractor said, those are good for much more than that, they'll be good for your 3000. I said, well what happens if one breaks? Well, it didn't go on break, but if it does, we'll prove, so we decided, we'll bring up this test. We'll take a bottle and put a scratch in it. These are very thin-walled bottles. They were cryo-stretched, aged cryoform material and stretched. And we'll put a scratch in it. We'll put a bottle pressurized next to it. And we'll build a case so strong that even if the bottle breaks, the case will hold the fragments. Oh, great. Set up this test. working with the thermochemical test area. We're going to have this test. We're going to have a 9,000 psi accumulator, fast opening valve, and the peep there. We're going to blow that bottle and prove that the case would hold the fragment. Fiberglass case. Okay. In the meantime, this test is being planned. It takes about six months or so to plan and carry out this test. In the meantime, we find out we don't have enough of these bottles. We're going to have to build, well, if we're going to build new ones, we'll just build them for 3000 psi and we'll use the unaged material and we already had it on hand. But I didn't call off the test. We go on the day of the test comes. I was over there at the cell looking at it. They had Fastex cameras. We had the lights and three, two, one, the guy hits the button for the fast opening valve and I watched the pressure gauge and all at once the cell went dark. Then I could see. Well it wasn't totally dark. Two of the lights had three lights. lights were out, the third one had fallen over and was shining up and down through that light was coming all these little tiny fingers of fiberglass, little whiskers of fiberglass coming down. Some guy had, we had left the full opening door on the back side of the cell open about a foot off the ground. We found 17 pieces of the bottles. We had one scratch bottle, one live bottle, and three dummies. Just pieces of aluminum just spun out for the same size. 17 pieces of the glass. One of the lights that was out had a piece of fiberglass driven right through the lens. In doing a post-mortem, which I was an expert at, that 9,000 psi holder had so much gas that even if by some miracle that case would miracle that case would hold all the fragments it couldn't hold the gas we it was vented but there was no way so we blew that thing now I had to write a letter for the director signature to dr. Davis Kurt Davis director of KSC essentially the letter would have to say something like this dr. Davis we just had a test that would have leveled a city block and it was a dumb test we should have run it but the same people that ran that test are the ones that are designing this system which we want you to use down there at the Cape. I think that's, I think I'm safe in claiming that record. Everybody loves to test but living with the results. I saw one of the bullets caught my attention and it said something to the effect make sure your specs widen as you go from component to system. Yeah. And is that the same thing as saying you write the requirements after you know what your hardware can do? That's probably a good thing to do. But, no, what I was getting at was, well, let me give you the example. We have a CO2 sensor, electrochemical CO2 sensor, and the requirement for response was when you had the sensor there and you hit it with a blast of CO2, You had to get to 67% of the max reading in X"

But, no, what I was getting at was, well, let me give you the example. We have a CO2 sensor, electrochemical CO2 sensor, and the requirement for response was when you had the sensor there and you hit it with a blast of CO2, You had to get to 67% of the max reading in X seconds. That was what told you you had a good sensor. You had that same spec for the sensor as a component and the same spec for the sensor in the system where you'd introduce the CO2 quite a ways away. And they passed for a long time. And then they started flunking. And we'd go and test them, and they were fine. We finally realized, duh, and we should have had a different spec added a few more seconds for the co2 to to get over to the the sensor set up instead of penalizing ourselves like that so you need to be aware now the other thing you can do what we've had a problem we had primary and secondary regulators that operated in bands and it turned out that way we have a regulator that operated out outside that band a little bit. Well, it turns out that this was the advertised band. Really, the actual band was much tighter, but the vendor would not guarantee that tighter band. So you could end up cherry-picking regulators and taking a waiver to the spec or rewriting your spec and absorbing the risk yourself. In other words, the vendor is not going to. We had batteries that were supposed to be 90-day wet life. We used them for over a year. The vendor never did admit his battery was good for any more than 90 days because he wanted to sell you batteries. We had the data that said they will be good for longer than that. So yes, there's something to be said for learning how your hardware actually behaves. And sometimes you can tighten your specs based on the population of hardware that you have that does operate better than advertised. Always introduce a dose of realism. If you try and live with spec. In other words, if you take a suit, you look at every component on the suit or every component in your system and you add up the max leakages, you don't have enough oxygen to do it. So what you use something like a root mean square or something which weights the heavier leakers more. But you know, come up with a realistic way to put your specs into place. Otherwise, you're living with something, sometimes you're living with just somebody's best guess, somebody's best number. And it's killing you. So you need to learn to push back on requirements that are really killing you. Anyone else? I got one. One of the things you said was you weren't happy at the end there in ACA, but what I wanted to make it clear was that it didn't have to do with the hardware that worked. This was a personality problem. So I just wanted to make that clear that it didn't have anything to do with the hardware or the job or anything like that. It was more of a human aspect. People problems. And I had the chance, I had the opportunity to change. Also, to be fair, this was one of the few opportunities I was going to have to get a 15. So, you know, there was that into it too. made up my mind if i didn't get that i wasn't going to stay there i was leaving anyway so there was there's a lot of factors that yeah was not didn't have anything to do with the hardware or the or the really the people that i that i worked with had more to do the guy worked for what do you think has kept your interest all these years to where it's still exciting uh solving problems and i did i wouldn't have said that 50 years ago i didn't like problems but but solving a problem is a really good feeling. And I realized pretty early on, I didn't really have the technical smarts to really be the one that would necessarily solve it. But being involved in a solution started meaning a lot. Like read F. Scott Peck's book, The Road Less Traveled. He's talked about, you better learn to like solving problems because that's what life is. That's kind of how you know you're alive, you know. I hurt, therefore I am, to paraphrase Descartes. When you were a little boy, what did you think you were? Wait a minute. Think back to when you were a really open mind, as I say, and tell us, when you were a little boy, what did you think you would be doing for the rest of your life? I had absolutely no idea. Did you have an interest in space? No. I got interested in space in 1951 when a friend of mine gave me the Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, which is not science fiction. It's really science fantasy. The writing is, guy, it's a beautiful writer. I mean, it's unbelievable writing. And I just started getting interested then. And when I applied with NASA, I applied at Lewis, and they laughed at me and sent my file on to Langley. and I got accepted in the space task group. I got a little card that said, Dear Sir or Madam, this is to inform you that your file has been received and you're being screened to see if you meet minimum qualifications for employment on Project Mercury. I didn't even know what Project Mercury was. Yeah. But when you're young, you can take chances. That's the time to do it. I was either going to go in the Peace Corps or go with NASA. I missed the Peace Corps entrance exam. Then NASA came through, So I went there. Who knows what my life would have been like? Who knows what the Peace Corps would have been like? How would you like to be remembered in the industry? What really is your proudest moment? I had a proud moment in one of these classes when a guy came up to me that I used to work with and he said, you know I remember what you said about using stuff before you had to. He said I made him run this thing through and fly it on a flight before it had to be flown which I did with the enhanced arms for SDS 79. We didn't need them for SDS 79 but I made people fly them, put them through the process and fly them anyway just to find out where our holes were. Pathfinding is an important thing to do with a new system or a new piece of hardware. Pathfind it and preferably do it before you have to have it. And he said I made him do that. He said I remember what you said. That felt great. The guy actually used something I told him. Would you like to go into space? Yeah I applied to be an astronaut several times was turned down"

Yeah I applied to be an astronaut several times was turned down several times would you still consider going if you could go John Glenn could go I could go yeah oh yeah you have any more books coming out any ideas for some new books yeah when I was 12 we just moved from Tulsa to Oklahoma City I was 12 my sister was 8 my brother was 4 and And having nothing else to do, my hobby was tormenting them. We had just moved into the city. I really didn't have any friends. My mother went up to the corner grocer and says, I want you to hire my son. I will pay you whatever you pay him, but I have to get him out of the house. He's driving me absolutely crazy. So the guy, he didn't remember. He remembered two guys running around together. I ran around with this guy, my one only friend there. He was about a foot taller than I was. He thought that's who he was hiring. He was hiring me. So I sat groceries for 12.5 cents an hour as I started. And I worked for him for six years and worked up to a dollar an hour. And he was an interesting guy. His whole family was in the grocery business. It turns out he'd been a pilot in World War II. He flew, after the war, he flew the bomber that dropped the bomb on any way talk at all when they were looking at the effect of bombs on atom bombs on ships they had a big article in Life magazine on him he had a copy of it he was an inventor he said running a grocery store ruined his life he was he would he would have been a great mechanical engineer but I learned everything I needed to know about working for him from him and his wife for working there that was probably one of the peak experiences of my life was learning how to work. And working for a guy that had his own business, I mean, you really get close to the road there. And I was thinking, he's still alive. In fact, my wife and I are going up to see him. He's in his 90s now. He lives up in Sepulveda, Oklahoma. We're going up to see him. He's blind. He's just about dying. And his daughter, who I met, she's a little younger than I am. I'm going to try and get some pictures. I'd like to write a book about my experiences in that grocery store. They were really something. That's one of the things I have in mind. What lessons did he teach you that have carried you through the space industry? Well it's not just space industry, anything. I talk about dependability. Be dependable. dependable. Be somebody that earn the trust. Earning trust. Earning your boss's trust. And be willing to work hard for not too much money. Great. Thank you Joe. Any parting words you'd like to bestow on us of wisdom? The Joe wisdom? Use sunscreen. Seriously. I've had about a dozen basal cell and a couple of squamous cell carcinoma was removed from my misspent youth of running out in the sun without a shirt. Great, thank you. Thank you."
